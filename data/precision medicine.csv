30699362,"Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma (SGR), known as Tu-fu-ling in the China, Japan and Korea, is an herb that has been used for clearing damp and detoxification in traditional Chinese medicine for many years. The post-harvest drying of SGR has traditionally been done by the sun, but sometimes sulfur fumigation is used instead due to its low cost and high efficiency. Recent reports show that sulfur fumigation can change the chemical constitution of herbal medicines and decrease their biology activity."
30699011,"Radiology reports are rich resources for biomedical researchers. Before utilization of radiology reports, experts must manually review these reports to identify the categories. In fact, automatically categorizing electronic medical record (EMR) text with key annotation is difficult because it has a free-text format. To address these problems, we developed an automated system for disease annotation."
30698999,"CRISPR technology has opened a new era of genome interrogation and genome engineering. Discovered in bacteria, where it protects against bacteriophage by cleaving foreign nucleic acid sequences, the CRISPR system has been repurposed as an adaptable tool for genome editing and multiple other applications. CRISPR's ease of use, precision, and versatility have led to its widespread adoption, accelerating biomedical research and discovery in human cells and model organisms. Here we review CRISPR-based tools and discuss how they are being applied to decode the genetic circuits that control immune function in health and disease. Genetic variation in immune cells can affect autoimmune disease risk, infectious disease pathogenesis, and cancer immunotherapies. CRISPR provides unprecedented opportunities for functional mechanistic studies of coding and noncoding genome sequence function in immunity. Finally, we discuss the potential of CRISPR technology to engineer synthetic cellular immunotherapies for a wide range of human diseases. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Immunology Volume 37 is April 26, 2019 Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
30698996,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for cancer progression. Evidence has shown that miR-22 and miR-214 play a key role in colon cancer progression; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be known. The effects of miR-22 and miR-214 on EMT are contradictory in different cancers, and whether miR-22 and miR-214 are involved in the colon cancer EMT process needs to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the exact role and the regulation mechanism of miR-22 and miR-214 in colon cancer. After transfection with miR-22 expression vector, the cell proliferation and migration capacity of HCT116 and RKO cells were significantly suppressed. Also, E-cadherin was increased and vimentin was decreased by miR-22 overexpression. Similar effects were also observed after miR-214 expression vector transfection. Dual-luciferase reporter confirmed that BCL9L is the target gene of both miR-22 and miR-214. Silencing of BCL9L inhibits cell proliferation and migration, and the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin was also altered by BCL9L knockdown, which was consistent with miR-22 or miR-214 transfection. Furthermore, miR-22 and miR-214 inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, although the association between BCL9L's lower expression and longer survival time was statistically nonsignificant, a trend existed; further studies in a larger cohort are needed. Collectively, these data suggest that miR-22 and miR-214 inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and EMT of colon cancer, most likely by targeting BCL9L.-Sun, R., Liu, Z., Han, L., Yang, Y., Wu, F., Jiang, Q., Zhang, H., Ma, R., Miao, J., He, K., Wang, X., Zhou, D., Huang, C. miR-22 and miR-214 targeting BCL9L inhibit proliferation, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by down-regulating Wnt signliang in colon cancer."
30698743,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play pivotal roles in directing RNA fate and function. Yet the current annotation of RBPs is largely limited to proteins carrying known RNA-binding domains. To systematically reveal dynamic RNA-protein interactions, we surveyed the human proteome by a protein array-based approach and identified 671 proteins with RNA-binding activity. Among these proteins, 525 lack annotated RNA-binding domains and are enriched in transcriptional and epigenetic regulators, metabolic enzymes, and small GTPases. Using an improved CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) method, we performed genome-wide target profiling of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), a novel RBP. IDH1 binds to thousands of RNA transcripts with enriched functions in transcription and chromatin regulation, cell cycle and RNA processing. Purified IDH1, but not an oncogenic mutant, binds directly to GA- or AU-rich RNA that are also enriched in IDH1 CLIP targets. Our study provides useful resources of unconventional RBPs and IDH1-bound transcriptome, and convincingly illustrates, for the first time, the in vivo and in vitro RNA targets and binding preferences of IDH1, revealing an unanticipated complexity of RNA regulation in diverse cellular processes."
30698723,"New psychoactive substances (NPSs) have become an integral part of the recreational drug market with ""new"" compounds being reported by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction weekly. Due to the changing nature of NPSs, it is impractical to carry out single analyte or even simple class quantitation. Although several gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods have been developed these are typically class specific. We present a validated GC-MS method for the quantitation of 2-DPMP, 3-MeO-PCE, 3-MeO-PCP, 5-APB, 6-APB, benzedrone, butylone, ethylone, flephedrone, methiopropamine, MDPV, mephedrone, methoxetamine, methylone, naphyrone, 25B-NBOME, 25C-NBOME, 25D-NBOMe, 25E-NBOME, 25H-NBOME, 25I-NBOME, Mescaline-NBOME and 25P-NBOME in blood and urine samples. Sample preparation was carried out using solid-phase extraction followed by derivatisation and analysis by GC-MS. Parameters investigated for validation included bias, precision, linear calibration model, carryover, interferences, limit of detection, limit of quantification, and autosampler and freeze/thaw stability. All drugs yielded successful results for each of these parameters as per SWGTOX guidelines. The GC-MS method was used for the reanalysis of 12 blood samples (eight cases) where 25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, methoxetamine and methylone had previously been detected by NMS laboratories. This GC-MS method was able to quantitatively detect these drugs in 75% of the blood samples, 42% of which contained either 25C-NBOMe or 25I-NBOMe. This method accurately allows for the simultaneous quantification of a wide variety of compounds via GC-MS, in particular NBOMe compounds which are typically analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry which is not available in all laboratories."
30698338,"The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and accurate gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for simultaneous determination of four urinary metabolites from four organic solvents, that is, hippuric acid (HA) from toluene, methylhippuric acid (MHA) from xylene, and mandelic acid (MA) and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA) from styrene or ethylbenzene for biological monitoring."
30698321,"Cancer treatment has made significant strides towards the promise of personalized medicine. Recent scientific advances have shown that there are numerous genetic deregulations that are common in multiple cancer types, raising the possibility of developing drugs targeting those deregulations irrespective of the tumour type. Precision cancer medicine was born out of accumulated evidence matching targeted agents with these tumour molecular deregulations. At the same time, the therapeutic armamentarium is rapidly increasing and the number of new drugs (including immune-oncology agents) entering drug development continues to rise. These factors, added to strong collaboration with regulatory agencies which have approved novel agents based on data obtained from Phase 1/2 trials, have led to unprecedented evolution in the design of early stage clinical trials. Currently, we have seen rapid Phase 1 dose escalation trials followed by remarkably large expansion cohorts, and are witnessing the emergence of new trials, such as adaptive studies with basket and umbrella designs aimed at optimizing the biomarker-drug co-development process. Alongside the growing complexity of these clinical trials, new frameworks for stronger and faster collaboration between all stakeholders in drug development, including academic institutions and frameworks, clinicians, pharma companies and regulatory agencies, have been established. In this review article, we describe the main challenges and opportunities that these new trial designs may provide for a more efficient drug development process, which may ultimately help ensure that precision cancer medicine becomes a reality for patients."
30698180,"In this paper we present for the first time a system comprised of two mobile phones, one for illumination and the other for microscopy, as a portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective microscopy platform for a wide range of applications. Versatile and adaptive illumination is made with a Retina display of an Apple mobile phone device. The phone screen is used to project various illumination patterns onto the specimen being imaged, each corresponding to a different illumination mode, such as bright-field, dark-field, point illumination, Rheinberg illumination, and fluorescence microscopy. The second phone (a Nokia phone) is modified to record microscopic images about the sample. This imaging platform provides a high spatial resolution of at least 2 μm, a large field-of-view of 3.6 × 2.7 mm, and a working distance of 0.6 mm. We demonstrate the performance of this platform for the visualization of microorganisms within microfluidic devices to gather qualitative and quantitative information regarding microorganism morphology, dimension, count, and velocity/trajectories in the x-y plane."
30698081,"We propose a method for recruiting asymptomatic Amyloid positive individuals in clinical trials, using a two-step process. We first select during a pre-screening phase a subset of individuals which are more likely to be amyloid positive based on the automatic analysis of data acquired during routine clinical practice, before doing a confirmatory PET-scan to these selected individuals only. This method leads to an increased number of recruitments and to a reduced number of PET-scans, resulting in a decrease in overall recruitment costs. We validate our method on three different cohorts, and consider five different classification algorithms for the pre-screening phase. We show that the best results are obtained using solely cognitive, genetic and socio-demographic features, as the slight increased performance when using MRI or longitudinal data is balanced by the cost increase they induce. We show that the proposed method generalizes well when tested on an independent cohort, and that the characteristics of the selected set of individuals are identical to the characteristics of a population selected in a standard way. The proposed approach shows how Machine Learning can be used effectively in practice to optimize recruitment costs in clinical trials."
30697355,"All studies to date involving platelet reactivity and gene testing document singular interventions and their associations with outcomes. The East Asian paradox has been well documented - Asians who have had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are at a lower risk of ischaemic events even though they have a higher platelet reactivity. Asians who have had a PCI also have a higher risk of bleeding. This article covers the differences in outcomes between Caucasians and Asians, and explores the impact of outcomes, highlighting differences between the two patient populations. Given the high prevalence of loss-of-function alleles in Asia, treatment strategies will differ for different populations. It is plausible that both platelet reactivity and gene testing should be used to inform holistic decision-making for all patients - Caucasian or Asian - with acute coronary syndrome who are undergoing PCI."
30697230,"Germline variants of <i>PIP4K2A</i> impact susceptibility of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) through inducing its overexpression. Although limited reports suggested the oncogenic role of <i>PIP4K2A</i> in cancers, regulatory network and prognostic effect of this gene remains poorly understood in tumorigenesis and leukemogenesis. In this study, we conducted genome-wide gene expression association analyses in pediatric B-ALL cohorts to discover expression associated genes and pathways, which is followed by the bioinformatics analyses to investigate the prognostic role of <i>PIP4K2A</i> and its related genes in multiple cancer types. 214 candidates were identified to be significantly associated with <i>PIP4K2A</i> expression in ALL patients, with known cancer-related genes rankings the top (e.g., <i>RAC2</i>, <i>RBL2</i>, and <i>TFDP1</i>). These candidates do not only tend to be clustered in the same types of leukemia, but can also separate the patients into novel molecular subtypes. <i>PIP4K2A</i> is noticed to be frequently overexpressed in multiple other types of leukemia and solid cancers from cancer cohorts including TCGA, and associated with its candidates in subtype-specific and cancer-specific manners. Interestingly, the association status varied in tumors compared to their matched normal tissues. Moreover, <i>PIP4K2A</i> and its related candidates exhibit stage-independent prognostic effects in multiple cancers, mostly with its lower expression significantly associated with longer overall survival (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Our findings reveal the transcriptional regulatory network of <i>PIP4K2A</i> in leukemia, and suggest its potentially important role on molecular subtypes of multiple cancers and subsequent treatment outcomes."
30697212,"<b>Objective:</b> To present the genetic causes of patients with primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) in Kuwait between 2004 and 2017. <b>Methods:</b> The data was obtained from the Kuwait National Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders Registry. Genomic DNA from patients with clinical and immunological features of PID was sequenced using Sanger sequencing (SS), next generation sequencing (NGS) of targeted genes, whole exome sequencing (WES), and/or whole genome sequencing (WGS). Functional assays were utilized to assess the biologic effect of identified variants. Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) for 22q11.2 deletion and genomic hybridizations arrays were performed when thymic defects were suspected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 264 patients were registered during the study period with predominance of patients with immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity (35.2%), followed by combined immunodeficiencies with associated syndromic features (24%). Parental consanguinity and family history suggestive of PID were reported in 213 (81%) and 145 patients (55%), respectively. Genetic testing of 206 patients resulted in a diagnostic yield of 70%. Mutations were identified in 46 different genes and more than 90% of the reported genetic defects were transmitted by in an autosomal recessive pattern. The majority of the mutations were missense mutations (57%) followed by deletions and frame shift mutations. Five novel disease-causing genes were discovered. <b>Conclusions:</b> Genetic testing should be an integral part in the management of primary immunodeficiency patients. This will help the delivery of precision medicine and facilitate proper genetic counseling. Studying inbred populations using sophisticated diagnostic methods can allow better understanding of the genetics of primary immunodeficiency disorders."
30697138,"With the initiatives by the National Institutes of Health and the US Food and Drug Administration, pharmacogenomics is transitioning from the laboratory to patient care. Nearly 200 drug products now contain pharmacogenomic information as part of their labeling; many of these products are commonly used in the pediatric population. Because pharmacogenomic testing can provide patient-specific predictors for drug response, pharmacists are positioned to assume a leadership role in pharmacogenomic testing, clinical interpretation of results, and recommendations for individualization of drug therapy. Opportunities for pharmacists exist in both inpatient and outpatient settings, such as pharmacist-managed clinical pharmacogenomics consultation services and educating patients and families about pharmacogenomic testing. Given the potential for genetic and age-dependent factors to influence drug selection and dosing, pediatric pharmacists should be involved in the development of dosing recommendations and interprofessional practice guidelines regarding pharmacogenomic testing in pediatric patients. Opportunities to become knowledgeable and competent in pharmacogenomics extend from coursework as part of the pharmacy curriculum to postgraduate education (e.g., residencies, fellowship, continuing education). The Pediatric Pharmacy Advocacy Group acknowledges a need for increased education of both students and practicing pharmacists with consideration for infants and children."

30697061,"Advancements in molecular and genetic techniques have significantly furthered our biological understanding of Ewing sarcoma (ES). ES is typified by a driving TET-ETS fusion with an otherwise relatively quiet genome. Detection of one of several characteristic fusions, most commonly <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i>, is the gold standard for diagnosis. We discuss the current role of precision medicine in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of ES. Continued efforts toward molecularly guided approaches are actively being pursued in ES to better refine prognosis, identify germline markers of disease susceptibility, influence therapeutic selection, effectively monitor disease activity in real time, and identify genetic and immunotherapeutic targets for therapeutic development."
30696943,"Simple visual items and complex real-world objects are stored into visual working memory as a collection of independent features, not as whole or integrated objects. Storing faces into memory might differ, however, since previous studies have reported perceptual and memory advantage for whole faces compared to other objects. We investigated whether facial features can be integrated in a statistically optimal fashion and whether memory maintenance disrupts this integration. The observers adjusted a probe - either a whole face or isolated features (eyes or mouth region) - to match the identity of a target while viewing both stimuli simultaneously or after a 1.5 second retention period. Precision was better for the whole face compared to the isolated features. Perceptual precision was higher than memory precision, as expected, and memory precision further declined as the number of memorized items was increased from one to four. Interestingly, the whole-face precision was better predicted by models assuming injection of memory noise followed by integration of features than by models assuming integration of features followed by the memory noise. The results suggest equally weighted or optimal integration of facial features and indicate that feature information is preserved in visual working memory while remembering faces."
30696919,"The complete genome of Cordyceps militaris was sequenced using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology at a coverage over 300×. The genome size was 32.57 Mb, and 14 contigs ranging from 0.35 to 4.58 Mb with an N50 of 2.86 Mb were assembled, including 4 contigs with telomeric sequences on both ends and an additional 8 contigs with telomeric sequences on either the 5' or 3' end. A methylome database of the genome was constructed using SMRT and m4C and m6A methylated nucleotides, and many unknown modification types were identified. The major m6A methylation motif is GA and GGAG, and the major m4C methylation motif is GC or CG/GC. In the C. militaris genome DNA, there were four types of methylated nucleotides that we confirmed using high-resolution LCMS-IT-TOF. Using PacBio Iso-Seq, a total of 31,133 complete cDNA sequences were obtained in the fruiting body. The conserved domains of the nontranscribed regions of the genome include TATA boxes, which are the initial regions of genome replication. There were 406 structural variants between the HN and CM01 strains, and there were 1,114 structural variants between the HN and ATCC strains."
30696880,"Histone methylation is thought to control the regulation of genetic program and the dysregulation of it has been found to be closely associated with cancer. JMJD3 has been identified as an H3K27 demethylase and its role in cancer development is context specific. The role of JMJD3 in gastric cancer (GC) has not been examined. In this study, JMJD3 expression was determined. The prognostic significance of JMJD3 and its association with clinical parameters were evaluated. JMJD3 dysregulation mechanism and targets were analyzed. The effect of JMJD3 mutation was determined by functional study. Results showed that JMJD3 was overexpressed in different patient cohorts and also by bioinformatics analysis. High JMJD3 expression was correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with GC and was an independent prognosis predictor. Genetic aberration and DNA methylation might be involved in the deregulation of JMJD3 in GC. Downstream network of JMJD3 was analyzed and several novel potential targets were identified. Furthermore, functional study discovered that both demethylase-dependent and demethylase-independent mechanisms were involved in the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC. Importantly, histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 could reverse the oncogenic effect of JMJD3 overexpression. In conclusion, our study report the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC for the first time. JMJD3 might serve as an important epigenetic therapeutic target and/or prognostic predictor in GC."
30696533,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the postoperative endoscopic score and the quality of life (QoL) in two groups of adults undergoing septoplasty with turbinoplasty and who were treated after surgery with a nasal spray containing silver vitellinate, hyaluronic acid and sodium benzoate, or saline solution alone. This single-blind randomized study was carried out on 54 patients (30 males, and 24 females, mean age 33.5±2.7 years) undergoing septoplasty and volumetric tissue reduction of inferior turbinates for nasal obstruction. All subjects underwent the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaire and the nasal endoscopy score by Lund and Kennedy (LK) at baseline before surgery (T0), 15 days (T15) and 21 days (T21) after treatment. All subjects were randomized into 2 groups, the experimental arm, group I (GI), and the control arm, group II (GII). Patients were given the treatment, a nasal spray containing silver vitellinate, hyaluronic acid and sodium benzoate for group I and a saline solution alone (sodium chloride 0.9%) for group II. After therapy, better VAS and LK scores were found (p less than0.05) in the GI in GII. No patients reported adverse reactions or complications. Our findings suggest that silver vitellinate, hyaluronic acid and sodium benzoate nasal spray improved not only the endoscopic score, but also the quality of life (QoL) in the early postoperative period after septoplasty. In addition, the absence of adverse reactions or complications pointed out the tolerability and safety of the treatment."
30696458,"International guidelines for variant interpretation in Mendelian disease set stringent criteria to report a variant as (likely) pathogenic, prioritising control of false-positive rate over test sensitivity and diagnostic yield. Genetic testing is also more likely informative in individuals with well-characterised variants from extensively studied European-ancestry populations. Inherited cardiomyopathies are relatively common Mendelian diseases that allow empirical calibration and assessment of this framework."
30696086,"Recent developments in high-throughput technologies have accelerated the accumulation of massive amounts of omics data from multiple sources: genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, etc. Traditionally, data from each source (e.g., genome) is analyzed in isolation using statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. Integrative analysis of multi-omics and clinical data is key to new biomedical discoveries and advancements in precision medicine. However, data integration poses new computational challenges as well as exacerbates the ones associated with single-omics studies. Specialized computational approaches are required to effectively and efficiently perform integrative analysis of biomedical data acquired from diverse modalities. In this review, we discuss state-of-the-art ML-based approaches for tackling five specific computational challenges associated with integrative analysis: curse of dimensionality, data heterogeneity, missing data, class imbalance and scalability issues."
30694562,"Age- and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted mammographic density is one the strongest breast cancer risk factors. DNA methylation is a molecular mechanism that could underlie inter-individual variation in mammographic density. We aimed to investigate the association between breast cancer risk-predicting mammographic density measures and blood DNA methylation. For 436 women from the Australian Mammographic Density Twins and Sisters Study and 591 women from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, mammographic density (dense area, non-dense area and percentage dense area) defined by the conventional brightness threshold was measured using the CUMULUS software, and peripheral blood DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip assay. Associations between DNA methylation at >400,000 sites and mammographic density measures adjusted for age and BMI were assessed within each cohort and pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Associations with methylation at genetic loci known to be associated with mammographic density were also examined. We found no genome-wide significant (P<10<sup>-7</sup> ) association for any mammographic density measure from the meta-analysis, or from the cohort-specific analyses. None of the 299 methylation sites located at genetic loci associated with mammographic density was associated with any mammographic density measure after adjusting for multiple testing (all P>0.05/299 = 1.7 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ). In summary, our study did not detect associations between blood DNA methylation, as measured by the HM450 assay, and conventional mammographic density measures that predict breast cancer risk.

30694442,"Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the ninth most common in women in the Western world. The management of bladder carcinoma requires a multidisciplinary approach. Optimal treatment depends on several factors, including histology, stage, patient status, and possible comorbidities. Here we review recent findings on the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma, advanced urothelial carcinoma, upper tract urothelial carcinoma, non-urothelial carcinoma, and urologic complications arising from the disease or treatment. In addition, we present the recommendations of the Spanish Oncology Genitourinary Group for the treatment of these diseases, based on a focused analysis of clinical management and the potential of current research, including recent findings on the potential benefit of immunotherapy. In recent years, whole-genome approaches have provided new predictive biomarkers and promising molecular targets that could lead to precision medicine in bladder cancer. Moreover, the involvement of other specialists in addition to urologists will ensure not only appropriate therapeutic decisions but also adequate follow-up for response evaluation and management of complications. It is crucial, however, to apply recent molecular findings and implement clinical guidelines as soon as possible in order to maximize therapeutic gains and improve patient prognosis."
30694417,"Computer-adaptive tests (CAT) use individualised sets of questions to assess patient-reported health states, whereas static (conventional) questionnaires present the same questions to all patients. CAT has been shown to increase measurement precision and reduce assessment length.

30694407,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive molecular imaging technique that traces the distribution of radiolabeled molecules in experimental animals and human subjects. We hypothesized that PET could be used to visualize the binding of the bronchodilator drug ipratropium to muscarinic receptors (MR) in the lungs of living non-human primates (NHP). The objectives of this study were two-fold: (i) to develop a methodology for quantitative imaging of muscarinic receptors in NHP lung and (ii) to estimate and compare ipratropium-induced MR occupancy following drug administration via intravenous injection and inhalation, respectively."
30693666,"The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been reported to be a prognostic marker in prostate cancer. In this study, we assessed the association between preoperative NLR and the clinicopathological characteristics, biomolecular features and prognosis of patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. A total of 994 subjects were retrospectively enrolled, and the histological specimens of 210 patients were retrieved for constructing a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemistry was then performed to assess the expression of AR, ERG, PTEN, p-AKT, Bcl-2, Beclin-1, Ki-67, CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN-γ and TNF-α. No significant differences in the NLR distributions among clinicopathological variables were observed (P > 0.05) when the original NLR data were utilized. When we dichotomized the NLR value into the high-NLR group (NLR ≥ 2) and low-NLR group (NLR < 2), we found that the patients in the high-NLR group had more prostate capsule invasion (P = 0.047). Additionally, no significant correlation was found between the NLR and infiltrating CD3<sup>+</sup> cells, the CD4/CD8 ratio, AR, ERG, PTEN, p-AKT, Bcl-2, Beclin-1, Ki-67, IFN-γ or TNF-α (P > 0.05). When we analyzed the data of patients without postoperative adjuvant hormone therapy or radiotherapy, univariate and multivariate survival analysis indicated that a high NLR was a predictor of better BCR-free survival (P < 0.05). When analyzing the entire cohort, univariate survival analysis showed that the high-NLR group had significantly poorer overall survival (P < 0.05). In conclusion, NLR cannot reflect prostate cancer characteristics or the local immune microenvironment, but a high NLR can serve as an independent predictor of better BCR."
30693528,"Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is a safe and ecofriendly analytical technique that has not been fully applied to the analysis of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This is the first study on the separation of six quality markers (Q-markers) including paeoniflorin, albiflorin, benzoyl paeoniflorin, oxypaeoniflorin, gallic acid, and benzoic acid from raw, wine-baked, and vinegar-baked Paeoniae Alba Radix (PAR) by SFC. Optimum separation was achieved on an HSS C<sub>18</sub> SB column (100×3.0 mm, 1.8 μm particles) with a gradient elution of high-purity carbon dioxide as mobile phase A and methanol/acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) with 0.10% phosphoric acid as mobile phase B. The flow rate was set at 0.7 mL/min for 15.0 min. The method was validated in terms of the overall intraday and interday precision, with relative standard deviation (RSDs) of 0.87-2.87% and 1.47-3.63%, respectively. The recoveries were 98.10-103.60% with an RSD of 1.00-3.40%. The stability of the RSD values was in the range of 1.10-3.78%. The developed approach was successfully applied and provides a valuable reference for the quality assessment of PAR and processed PAR. The results also revealed that the standardization of processing technology is of great significance to the fluctuations in quality before and after the processing of TCM."
30693378,"This Strategic Research Agenda identifies current challenges and needs in healthcare, illustrates how biomedical imaging and derived data can help to address these, and aims to stimulate dedicated research funding efforts.Medicine is currently moving towards a more tailored, patient-centric approach by providing personalised solutions for the individual patient. Innovation in biomedical imaging plays a key role in this process as it addresses the current needs for individualised prevention, treatment, therapy response monitoring, and image-guided surgery.The use of non-invasive biomarkers facilitates better therapy prediction and monitoring, leading to improved patient outcomes. Innovative diagnostic imaging technologies provide information about disease characteristics which, coupled with biological, genetic and -omics data, will contribute to an individualised diagnosis and therapy approach.In the emerging field of theranostics, imaging tools together with therapeutic agents enable the selection of best treatments and allow tailored therapeutic interventions.For prenatal monitoring, the use of innovative imaging technologies can ensure an early detection of malfunctions or disease.The application of biomedical imaging for diagnosis and management of lifestyle-induced diseases will help to avoid disease development through lifestyle changes.Artificial intelligence and machine learning in imaging will facilitate the improvement of image interpretation and lead to better disease prediction and therapy planning.As biomedical imaging technologies and analysis of existing imaging data provide solutions to current challenges and needs in healthcare, appropriate funding for dedicated research is needed to implement the innovative approaches for the wellbeing of citizens and patients."
30693334,"Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<sub>m</sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup>) uptake mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) plays a critical role in signal transduction, bioenergetics, and cell death, and its dysregulation is linked to several human diseases. In this study, we report a new ruthenium complex Ru265 that is cell-permeable, minimally toxic, and highly potent with respect to MCU inhibition. Cells treated with Ru265 show inhibited MCU activity without any effect on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>). Dose-dependent studies reveal that Ru265 is more potent than the currently employed MCU inhibitor Ru360. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys97 in the N-terminal domain of human MCU ablates the inhibitory activity of Ru265, suggesting that this matrix-residing domain is its target site. Additionally, Ru265 prevented hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction, demonstrating that this new inhibitor is a valuable tool for studying the functional role of the MCU in intact biological models."
30693283,"Interleukin (IL)-17A has a direct contribution in early induction and late chronic stages of various inflammatory diseases. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments have first characterized its local effects on different cell types and then its systemic effects. For instance, IL-17 axis is now identified as a key driver of psoriasis through its effects on keratinocytes. Similar observations apply for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where IL-17A triggers changes in the synovium that lead to synovitis and maintain local inflammation. These results have prompted the development of biologics to target this cytokine. However, while convincing studies are reported on the efficacy of IL-17 inhibitors in psoriasis, there are conflicting results in RA. Patient heterogeneity but also the involvement of mediators that regulate IL-17 function may explain these results. Therefore, new tools and concepts are required to identify patients that could benefit from these IL-17 targeted therapies in RA and the development of predictive biomarkers of response has started with the emergence of various bioassays. Current strategies are also focusing on synovial biopsies that may be used to stratify patients. From local to systemic levels, new approaches are developing and move the field of RA management into the era of precision medicine."
30692685,"MALT1 paracaspase is central for lymphocyte antigen-dependent responses including NF-κB activation. We discovered nanomolar, selective allosteric inhibitors of MALT1 that bind by displacing the side chain of Trp580, locking the protease in an inactive conformation. Interestingly, we had previously identified a patient homozygous for a MALT1 Trp580-to-serine mutation who suffered from combined immunodeficiency. We show that the loss of tryptophan weakened interactions between the paracaspase and C-terminal immunoglobulin MALT1 domains resulting in protein instability, reduced protein levels and functions. Upon binding of allosteric inhibitors of increasing potency, we found proportionate increased stabilization of MALT1-W580S to reach that of wild-type MALT1. With restored levels of stable MALT1 protein, the most potent of the allosteric inhibitors rescued NF-κB and JNK signaling in patient lymphocytes. Following compound washout, MALT1 substrate cleavage was partly recovered. Thus, a molecular corrector rescues an enzyme deficiency by substituting for the mutated residue, inspiring new potential precision therapies to increase mutant enzyme activity in other deficiencies."

30692261,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. A key pathogenic factor in the development of lethal heart failure is loss of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. However, mechanisms of cardiomyocyte death remain unclear. Here, we discovered and demonstrated that ferroptosis, a programmed iron-dependent cell death, as a mechanism in murine models of doxorubicin (DOX)- and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiomyopathy. In canonical apoptosis and/or necroptosis-defective <i>Ripk3</i><sup>-/-</sup>, <i>Mlkl</i><sup>-/-</sup>, or <i>Fadd</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>Mlkl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, DOX-treated cardiomyocytes showed features of typical ferroptotic cell death. Consistently, compared with dexrazoxane, the only FDA-approved drug for treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, inhibition of ferroptosis by ferrostatin-1 significantly reduced DOX cardiomyopathy. RNA-sequencing results revealed that heme oxygenase-1 (<i>Hmox1</i>) was significantly up-regulated in DOX-treated murine hearts. Administering DOX to mice induced cardiomyopathy with a rapid, systemic accumulation of nonheme iron via heme degradation by Nrf2-mediated up-regulation of Hmox1, which effect was abolished in <i>Nrf2</i>-deficent mice. Conversely, zinc protoporphyrin IX, an Hmox1 antagonist, protected the DOX-treated mice, suggesting free iron released on heme degradation is necessary and sufficient to induce cardiac injury. Given that ferroptosis is driven by damage to lipid membranes, we further investigated and found that excess free iron accumulated in mitochondria and caused lipid peroxidation on its membrane. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO significantly rescued DOX cardiomyopathy, supporting oxidative damage of mitochondria as a major mechanism in ferroptosis-induced heart damage. Importantly, ferrostatin-1 and iron chelation also ameliorated heart failure induced by both acute and chronic I/R in mice. These findings highlight that targeting ferroptosis serves as a cardioprotective strategy for cardiomyopathy prevention."
30691596,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‒based regenerative therapy is a promising strategy for cardiovascular disease treatment; however, the method is limited by the myocardial retention of grafted iPSCs. Thus, an injection protocol that efficiently introduces and retains human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) within the myocardium is urgently needed. The objective of the present study was to develop a method to improve the retention of hiPSCs in the myocardium for cardiac therapy."
30691501,"Increasing evidence has suggested that the presence of remnant lipoproteins is a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis. Remnant lipoproteins are lipoproteins that are rich in triglycerides (TGs), and the main components include very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the fasting state. Diabetic patients often have hypertriglyceridemia with elevated levels of VLDL cholesterol but normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The aim of the present study was to elucidate the potential role of remnant lipoproteins-induced atherosclerosis in the occurrence and development of in-stent restenosis (ISR) in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease."

30691222,"The response of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the first-line conventional combination therapy is highly variable, reflecting the elevated heterogeneity of the disease. The genetic alterations underlying this heterogeneity have been thoroughly characterized through omic approaches requiring elevated efforts and costs. In order to translate the knowledge of CRC molecular heterogeneity into a practical clinical approach, we utilized a simplified Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based platform to screen a cohort of 77 patients treated with first-line conventional therapy. Samples were sequenced using a panel of hotspots and targeted regions of 22 genes commonly involved in CRC. This revealed 51 patients carrying actionable gene mutations, 22 of which carried druggable alterations. These mutations were frequently associated with additional genetic alterations. To take into account this molecular complexity and assisted by an unbiased bioinformatic analysis, we defined three subgroups of patients carrying distinct molecular patterns. We demonstrated these three molecular subgroups are associated with a different response to first-line conventional combination therapies. The best outcome was achieved in patients exclusively carrying mutations on <i>TP53</i> and/or <i>RAS</i> genes. By contrast, in patients carrying mutations in any of the other genes, alone or associated with mutations of <i>TP53/RAS</i>, the expected response is much worse compared to patients with exclusive <i>TP53/RAS</i> mutations. Additionally, our data indicate that the standard approach has limited efficacy in patients without any mutations in the genes included in the panel. In conclusion, we identified a reliable and easy-to-use approach for a simplified molecular-based stratification of mCRC patients that predicts the efficacy of the first-line conventional combination therapy."
30691108,Current standard-of-care (SOC) therapy for breast cancer includes targeted therapies such as endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) positive; anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-enriched; and general chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. These therapies frequently fail due to acquired or inherent resistance. Altered metabolism has been recognized as one of the major mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance. There are several cues that dictate metabolic reprogramming that also account for the tumors' metabolic plasticity. For metabolic therapy to be efficacious there is a need to understand the metabolic underpinnings of the different subtypes of breast cancer as well as the role the SOC treatments play in targeting the metabolic phenotype. Understanding the mechanism will allow us to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. There are some very interesting questions being tackled by researchers today as they pertain to altered metabolism in breast cancer. What are the metabolic differences between the different subtypes of breast cancer? Do cancer cells have a metabolic pathway preference based on the site and stage of metastasis? How do the cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic cues dictate the metabolic phenotype? How do the nucleus and mitochondria coordinately regulate metabolism? How does sensitivity or resistance to SOC affect metabolic reprogramming and vice-versa? This review addresses these issues along with the latest updates in the field of breast cancer metabolism.
30691095,"<i>Objectives:</i> To carry out an integrated and stratified meta-analysis on occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), metals and pesticides and its effects on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and investigate the possibility of publication bias. <i>Methods</i>: In the current study, we updated our recently published meta-analyses on occupational exposures in relation to ALS, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Based on 66 original publications of good scientific epidemiological standard, according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) guidelines, we analysed subgroups by carrying out stratified meta-analyses on publication year, statistical precision of the relative risk (RR) estimates, inspection of the funnel plots and test of bias. <i>Results</i>: Based on 19 studies the weighted RR for occupational exposure to EMFs was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07⁻1.50) for ALS, 1.33 (95% CI 1.07⁻1.64) for Alzheimer's disease and 1.02 (95% CI 0.83⁻1.26) for Parkinson's disease. Thirty-one studies concerned occupational exposure to pesticides and the weighted RR was 1.35 (95% CI 1.02⁻1.79) for ALS, 1.50 (95% CI 0.98⁻2.29) for Alzheimer's disease and 1.66 (95% CI 1.42⁻1.94) for Parkinson's disease. Finally, 14 studies concerned occupational exposure to metals and only exposure to lead (five studies) involved an elevated risk for ALS or Parkinson's disease and the weighted RR was 1.57 (95% CI 1.11⁻2.20). The weighted RR for all the non-lead exposures was 0.97 (95% CI 0.88⁻1.06). <i>Conclusions</i>: Exposure to pesticides increased the risk of getting the mentioned neurodegenerative diseases by at least 50%. Exposure to lead was only studied for ALS and Parkinson's disease and involved 50% increased risk. Occupational exposure to EMFs seemed to involve some 10% increase in risk for ALS and Alzheimer's disease only."
30691078,"This study reports the development and validation of a new, simple, and accurate high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)-densitomeric method for the determination of nandrolone decanoate in a commercially available injection formulation. Chromatographic analysis was performed on glass CN modified silica gel 60F<sub>254</sub> plates developed using n-hexane-ethyl acetate in volume ratio 42.5:7.5 as the mobile phase. Densitometric scanning was carried out at the wavelength of 245 nm. This chromatographic system gave compact spot and a symmetrical peak of nandrolone decanoate with retardation factor (R<sub>F</sub>) value at 0.57 (±0.02). The linearity of this method with the high correlation coefficient of calibration plot ranges from 0.780 to 12.500 μg/spot. The developed method is characterized by good precision (coefficient of variation CV < 2%) and high accuracy close to 100.3% (R = 99.0%). Values of limits of detection and quantification equal to 0.231 and 0.700 μg/spot, respectively, confirm the sensitivity of the developed method. The analysis of the pharmaceutical formulation of nandrolone decanoate indicates drug content of 50.5 mg/mL and 101.0% in relation to the label claim. This is in good agreement with the recommendation of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines as well as the pharmacopoeial requirements. The low CV value (<1%) of nandrolone decanoate content in the tested injection formulation confirms the suitability of the proposed HPTLC-densitometric method for routine control of this compound in examined pharmaceuticals."

30690726,"The widely used second-line antituberculosis drug ethionamide shows wide interindividual variability in its disposition; however, the relevant factors affecting this phenomenon have not been characterized. We previously reported the major contribution of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) in the reductive elimination pathway of ethionamide. In this study, ethionamide metabolism was potentially inhibited by methimazole in vitro. The drug-drug interaction leading to methimazole affecting the disposition of ethionamide mediated by FMO3 was then quantitated using a bottom-up approach with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic framework. The maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ) and area under the curve (AUC) of ethionamide were estimated to increase by 13% and 16%, respectively, when coadministered with methimazole. Subsequently, we explored the effect of FMO3 genetic polymorphism on metabolic capacity, by constructing 2 common functional variants, Lys<sup>158</sup> -FMO3 and Gly<sup>308</sup> -FMO3. Compared to the wild type, recombinant Lys<sup>158</sup> -FMO3 and Gly<sup>308</sup> -FMO3 variants significantly decreased the intrinsic clearance of ethionamide by 2% and 24%, respectively. Two prevalent functional variants of FMO3 were predicted to affect ethionamide disposition, with mean ratios of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of up to 1.5 and 1.7, respectively, in comparison with the wild type. In comparing single ethionamide administration with the wild type, simulations of the combined effects of comedications and FMO3 genetic polymorphism estimated that the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC ratios of ethionamide increased up to 1.7 and 2.0, respectively. These findings suggested that FMO3-mediated drug-drug interaction and genetic polymorphism could be important determinants of interindividual heterogeneity in ethionamide disposition that need to be considered comprehensively to optimize the personalized dosing of ethionamide."

However, NTDs have been observed among offspring of women with adequate folic acid intake. Some of these women are possibly not absorbing enough folic acid. Because lactase deficiency can lead to poor nutrient absorption, we hypothesized that lactase-deficient women will be at increased risk of having offspring with NTDs."
30689862,"Segmental duplications are an important class of mutations. Because a large proportion of segmental duplications may often be strongly deleterious, high frequency or fixed segmental duplications may represent only a tiny fraction of the mutational input. To understand the emergence and elimination of segmental duplications, we survey polymorphic duplications, including tandem and interspersed duplications, in natural populations of Drosophila by haploid embryo genomes. As haploid embryos are not expected to be heterozygous the genome, sites of heterozygosity (referred to as pseudoheterozygous sites, or PHS), may likely represent recent duplications that have acquired new mutations. Among the 29 genomes of D. melanogaster, we identify 2282 polymorphic PHS duplications (linked PHS regions) in total or 154 PHS duplications per genome. Most PHS duplications are small (83.4% < 500 bp), D. melanogaster lineage specific, and strain specific (72.6% singletons). The excess of the observed singleton PHS duplications deviates significantly from the neutral expectation, suggesting that most PHS duplications are strongly deleterious. In addition, these small segmental duplications are not evenly distributed in genomic regions and less common in non-coding functional element regions. The underrepresentation in Pol II binding sites and regions with active histone modifications is correlated with ages of duplications. In conclusion, small segmental duplications occur frequently in Drosophila but rapidly eliminated by natural selection."
30689846,"The Precision Medicine Initiative is a multicenter effort aiming at formulating personalized treatments leveraging on individual patient data (clinical, genome sequence and functional genomic data) together with the information in large knowledge bases (KBs) that integrate genome annotation, disease association studies, electronic health records and other data types. The biomedical literature provides a rich foundation for populating these KBs, reporting genetic and molecular interactions that provide the scaffold for the cellular regulatory systems and detailing the influence of genetic variants in these interactions. The goal of BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track was to extract this particular type of information and was organized in two tasks: (i) document triage task, focused on identifying scientific literature containing experimentally verified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) affected by genetic mutations and (ii) relation extraction task, focused on extracting the affected interactions (protein pairs). To assist system developers and task participants, a large-scale corpus of PubMed documents was manually annotated for this task. Ten teams worldwide contributed 22 distinct text-mining models for the document triage task, and six teams worldwide contributed 14 different text-mining systems for the relation extraction task. When comparing the text-mining system predictions with human annotations, for the triage task, the best F-score was 69.06%, the best precision was 62.89%, the best recall was 98.0% and the best average precision was 72.5%. For the relation extraction task, when taking homologous genes into account, the best F-score was 37.73%, the best precision was 46.5% and the best recall was 54.1%. Submitted systems explored a wide range of methods, from traditional rule-based, statistical and machine learning systems to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Given the level of participation and the individual team results we find the precision medicine track to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community. In the meantime, the track produced a manually annotated corpus of 5509 PubMed documents developed by BioGRID curators and relevant for precision medicine. The data set is freely available to the community, and the specific interactions have been integrated into the BioGRID data set. In addition, this challenge provided the first results of automatically identifying PubMed articles that describe PPI affected by mutations, as well as extracting the affected relations from those articles. Still, much progress is needed for computer-assisted precision medicine text mining to become mainstream. Future work should focus on addressing the remaining technical challenges and incorporating the practical benefits of text-mining tools into real-world precision medicine information-related curation."
30689737,"The genomic predisposition to oncology-drug-induced cardiovascular toxicity has been postulated for many decades. Only recently has it become possible to experimentally validate this hypothesis via the use of patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and suitably powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Identifying the individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for the susceptibility to toxicity from a specific drug is a daunting task as this precludes the use of one of the most powerful tools in genomics: comparing phenotypes to close relatives, as these are highly unlikely to have been treated with the same drug. Great strides have been made through the use of candidate gene association studies (CGAS) and increasingly large GWAS studies, as well as in vivo whole-organism studies to further our mechanistic understanding of this toxicity. The hiPSC model is a powerful technology to build on this work and identify and validate causal variants in mechanistic pathways through directed genomic editing such as CRISPR. The causative variants identified through these studies can then be implemented clinically to identify those likely to experience cardiovascular toxicity and guide treatment options. Additionally, targets identified through hiPSC studies can inform future drug development. Through careful phenotypic characterization, identification of genomic variants that contribute to gene function and expression, and genomic editing to verify mechanistic pathways, hiPSC technology is a critical tool for drug discovery and the realization of precision medicine in cardio-oncology."

30689658,"Clinical flow cytometry is a reliable methodology for whole blood cell phenotyping for different applications. The BD FACSLyric™ system comprises a flow cytometer available in different optical configurations, BD FACSuite™ Clinical software, and optional BD FACS™ Universal Loader. BD FACSuite Clinical software used with BD™ FC Beads and BD CS&T Beads enable universal setup for performance QC, instrument control, data acquisition/storage, online/offline data analysis, and instrument standardization. BD Biosciences sponsored the clinical evaluation of the BD FACSLyric 10-color configuration at seven clinical sites using delinked and de-identified blood specimens from HIV-infected and uninfected subjects to enumerate T-, B-, and NK-lymphocytes with the BD Multitest™ reagents (BD Multitest IMK kit and BD Multitest 6-color TBNK). Samples were analyzed on the BD FACSLyric system with BD FACSuite Clinical software, and on the BD FACSCanto™ II system with BD FACSCanto clinical software and BD FACS 7-Color Setup beads. For equivalency between methods, data (n = 362) were analyzed with Deming regression for absolute count and percentage of lymphocytes. Results gave R2 ≥0.98, with slope values ≥0.96, and slope ranges between 0.90-1.05. The percent (%) bias values were <10% for T- and NK cells and <15% for B- cells. The between-site (n = 4) total precision was tested for 5 days (2 runs/day), and gave %coefficient of variation below 10% for absolute cell counts. The stability claims were confirmed (n = 186) for the two BD Multitest reagents. The reference intervals were re-established in male and female adults (n = 134). The analysis by gender showed statistically significant differences for CD3+ and CD4+ T-cell counts and %CD4. In summary, the BD FACSLyric and the BD FACSCanto II systems generated comparable measurements of T-, B-, and NK-cells using BD Multitest assays."
30689231,"Breast cancer was the first to take advantage of targeted therapy using endocrine therapy, and for up to 20% of all breast cancer patients a further significant improvement has been obtained by HER2-targeted therapy. Greater insight in precision medicine is to some extent driven by technical and computational progress, with the first wave of a true technical advancement being the application of transcriptomic analysis. Molecular subtyping further improved our understanding of breast cancer biology and has through a new tumor classification enabled allocation of personalized treatment regimens. The next wave in technical progression must be next-generation-sequencing which is currently providing new and exciting results. Large-scale sequencing data unravel novel somatic and potential targetable mutations as well as allowing the identification of new candidate genes predisposing for familial breast cancer. So far, around 15% of all breast cancer patients are genetically predisposed with most genes being factors in pathways implicated in genome maintenance. This review focuses on whole-genome sequencing and the new possibilities that this technique, together with other high-throughput analytic approaches, provides for a more individualized treatment course of breast cancer patients."
30689186,"Pure breed dogs of Western origin are increasingly more popular in China as is a need to differentiate breeds and individual dogs for personal and forensic reasons. Research on genetic diversities of the canine population in China is rarely conducted. In this study, genetic distributions and forensic efficiencies of 19 canine STR loci in Labrador Retriever population from China were evaluated by using one available commercial canine kit in China. This panel was used to genetically define 214 Labrador Retrievers in China, as an example of one of the most important Western breeds and to compare them with Labrador Retrievers from America based on three overlapping STR loci. Moreover, genetic relationship analyses between Labrador Retriever population and two reference populations in America were performed. All 19 STR loci were polymorphic and conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the studied population. The STR panel was able to discern individual dogs with a high degree of accuracy. Breed-wide genetic heterozygosity comparisons based on present and published allele frequencies revealed that the studied population had the lower genetic heterozygosity than canine populations in America. Principal component analysis among Labrador Retriever population and other reference populations showed that the studied Labrador Retrievers were genetically close to the retriever breeds in America. Population genetic structure analyses among these canine breeds further revealed genetic differentiations between the studied Labrador Retriever population and other compared breeds. In conclusion, these STR loci had relatively high forensic values in Labrador Retriever population in China, which could be employed for individual identification and kinship testing."

30688961,"Cell phones show considerable promise for point-of-care (POC) diagnostic procedures because they are accessible, connected, and computationally powerful. Cell phone image processing methods are being developed for the detection and quantification of a wide range of targets, employing methods from microscopy to fluorescence techniques. However, most of the lab-based biological and biochemical assays still lack a robust and repeatable cell phone analogue. Existing solutions require external smartphone hardware to obtain quantitative results, imposing a design tradeoff between accessibility and accuracy. Here, we develop a cell phone imaging algorithm that enables analysis of assays that would typically be evaluated via spectroscopy. The developed technique uses the saturation parameter of hue-saturation-value color space to enable POC diagnosis. Through the analysis of over 10 000 images, we show that the saturation method consistently outperforms existing algorithms under a wide range of operating field conditions. The performance improvement is also proven analytically via the mathematic relationship between the saturation method and existing techniques. The method presented here is a step forward towards the development of POC diagnostics by reducing the required equipment, improving the limit of detection (LOD), and increasing the precision of quantitative results."
30688782,"Surveys provide evidence on practice, attitudes, and knowledge. However, conducting good survey research is harder than it looks. The authors aim to provide guidance to both researchers and readers in conducting and interpreting survey research. Like all research, surveys should have clear research question(s) using the smallest possible number of high-quality, essential, survey questions (items) that will interest the target population. Both researchers and readers should put themselves in the position of the respondents. The survey questions should provide reproducible results (reliable), measure what they are supposed to measure (valid), and take less than 10 min to answer. Good survey research reports provide results with valid and reliable answers to the research question with an adequate response rate (at least 40%) and adequate precision (margin of error ideally 5% or less). Possible biases among those who did not respond (nonresponders) must be carefully analyzed and discussed. Quantitative results can be combined with qualitative results in mixed-methods research to provide greater insight."

30687926,"National and state public health genomics efforts exist to effectively and responsibly translate genome-based knowledge to improve population health and reduce health disparities. Over the past two decades, public health genomics efforts have utilized the core public health functions of assessment, policy development, and assurance. Current evidence for a small number of genomic applications suggests that many lives could be saved if these were implemented in recommended populations. With the drastic increase in new genetic tests and technologies, multidisciplinary public health genomics efforts that should include public health dentistry are of greater importance. There is a need to integrate public health dentistry in efforts to increase use of evidence-based genomic tests and services to improve health outcomes. Additionally, public health genomic efforts also are utilized to promote awareness about the insufficient evidence of the validity, utility and ethical, legal, and social implications for the vast majority of genomic tests. This is demonstrated by a recent genetic testing policy statement and educational resources from the American Dental Association. These organizational efforts should be considered in other realms of public health genomics to ensure that only genetic tests and preventive services with sufficient evidence for use are being implemented in clinical and public health."
30687721,"Features of intensive farming can seriously threaten pig homeostasis, well-being and productivity. Disease tolerance of an organism is the adaptive ability in preserving homeostasis and at the same time limiting the detrimental impact that infection can inflict on its health and performance without affecting pathogen burden <i>per se</i>. While disease resistance (DRs) can be assessed measuring appropriately the pathogen burden within the host, the tolerance cannot be quantified easily. Indeed, it requires the assessment of the changes in performance as well as the changes in pathogen burden. In this paper, special attention is given to criteria required to standardize methodologies for assessing disease tolerance (DT) in respect of infectious diseases in pigs. The concept is applied to different areas of expertise and specific examples are given. The basic physiological mechanisms of DT are reviewed. Disease tolerance pathways, genetics of the tolerance-related traits, stress and disease tolerance, and role of metabolic stress in DT are described. In addition, methodologies based on monitoring of growth and reproductive performance, welfare, emotional affective states, sickness behavior for assessment of disease tolerance, and methodologies based on the relationship between environmental challenges and disease tolerance are considered. Automated Precision Livestock Farming technologies available for monitoring performance, health and welfare-related measures in pig farms, and their limitations regarding DT in pigs are also presented. Since defining standardized methodologies for assessing DT is a serious challenge for biologists, animal scientists and veterinarians, this work should contribute to improvement of health, welfare and production in pigs."
30687640,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease characterized by a clonal evolution across the course of the diseases and multiple lines of treatment. Among genomic drivers of the disease, alterations of the tumor suppressor <i>TP53</i> are associated with poor outcomes. In physiological situation, once activated by oncogenic stress or DNA damage, p53 induces either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the cellular context. Its inactivation participates to drug resistance in MM. The frequency of <i>TP53</i> alterations increases along with the progression of the disease, from 5 at diagnosis to 75% at late relapses. Multiple mechanisms of regulation lead to decreased expression of p53, such as deletion 17p, <i>TP53</i> mutations, specific microRNAs overexpression, <i>TP53</i> promoter methylations, and <i>MDM2</i> overexpression. Several therapeutic approaches aim to target the p53 pathway, either by blocking its interaction with MDM2 or by restoring the function of the altered protein. In this review, we describe the mechanism of deregulation of <i>TP53</i> in MM, its role in MM progression, and the therapeutic options to interact with the <i>TP53</i> pathway."

30687561,"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with unique genomic and phenotypic features that differ between individual patients and even among individual tumor regions. In recent years, large-scale genomic studies and new next-generation sequencing technologies have uncovered more scientific details about tumor heterogeneity, with significant implications for the choice of specific molecular biomarkers and clinical decision making. Genomic heterogeneity significantly contributes to the generation of a diverse cell population during tumor development and progression, representing a determining factor for variation in tumor treatment response. It has been considered a prominent contributor to therapeutic failure, and increases the likelihood of resistance to future therapies in most common cancers. The understanding of molecular heterogeneity in cancer is a fundamental component of precision oncology, enabling the identification of genomic alteration of key genes and pathways that can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we review the emerging knowledge of tumor genomics and heterogeneity, as well as potential implications for precision medicine in cancer treatment and new therapeutic discoveries. An analysis and interpretation of the TCGA database was included."
30686995,"Predicting progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically important. In this study, we propose a dual-model radiomic analysis with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to investigate promising risk factors associated with MCI conversion to AD. T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data, from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database, were collected from 131 patients with MCI who converted to AD within 3 years and 132 patients with MCI without conversion within 3 years. These subjects were randomly partition into 70% training dataset and 30% test dataset with multiple times. We fused MRI and PET images by wavelet method. In a subset of subjects, a group comparison was performed using a two-sample <i>t</i>-test to determine regions of interest (ROIs) associated with MCI conversion. 172 radiomic features from ROIs for each individual were established using a published radiomics tool. Finally, L1-penalized Cox model was constructed and Harrell's C index (C-index) was used to evaluate prediction accuracy of the model. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed method, we used a same analysis framework to evaluate MRI and PET data separately. We constructed prognostic Cox models with: clinical data, MRI images, PET images, fused MRI/PET images, and clinical variables and fused MRI/PET images in combination. The experimental results showed that captured ROIs significantly associated with conversion to AD, such as gray matter atrophy in the bilateral hippocampus and hypometabolism in the temporoparietal cortex. Imaging model (MRI/PET/fused) provided significant enhancement in prediction of conversion compared to clinical models, especially the fused-modality Cox model. Moreover, the combination of fused-modality imaging and clinical variables resulted in the greatest accuracy of prediction. The average C-index for the clinical/MRI/PET/fused/combined model in the test dataset was 0.69, 0.73, 0.73 and 0.75, and 0.78, respectively. These results suggested that a combination of radiomic analysis and Cox model analyses could be used successfully in survival analysis and may be powerful tools for personalized precision medicine patients with potential to undergo conversion from MCI to AD."
30686761,"Identification of the genomic drivers of cancer has led to the clinical development of targeted therapies that strike at the heart of many malignancies. Nonetheless, many cancers outsmart such precision-medicine efforts, and thus therapeutic resistance contributes significantly to cancer mortality. Attempts to understand the basis for resistance in patient samples and laboratory models has yielded two major benefits: one, more effective chemical inhibitors and rational combination therapies are now employed to prevent or circumvent resistance pathways; and two, our understanding of how oncogenic mutations drive cancer cell survival and oncogene addiction is deeper and broader, highlighting downstream or parallel cellular programs that shape these phenotypes. This review discusses emerging principles of resistance to therapies targeted against key oncogenic drivers."
30686690,"The use of video examinations (VE) may improve patient care by offering them a low-cost and easy access to physicians, save traveling expenses and shorten waiting time. The aim of this study was to validate the use of Smartphones for distant assessment of shoulder function by comparing the Constant scores (CS) of patients obtained by both VE and conventional face-to-face (FTF) examination."
30686581,"Tissue engineering using cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells holds a promise to revolutionize drug discovery, but only if limitations related to cardiac chamber specification and platform versatility can be overcome. We describe here a scalable tissue-cultivation platform that is cell source agnostic and enables drug testing under electrical pacing. The plastic platform enabled on-line noninvasive recording of passive tension, active force, contractile dynamics, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, as well as endpoint assessments of action potentials and conduction velocity. By combining directed cell differentiation with electrical field conditioning, we engineered electrophysiologically distinct atrial and ventricular tissues with chamber-specific drug responses and gene expression. We report, for the first time, engineering of heteropolar cardiac tissues containing distinct atrial and ventricular ends, and we demonstrate their spatially confined responses to serotonin and ranolazine. Uniquely, electrical conditioning for up to 8 months enabled modeling of polygenic left ventricular hypertrophy starting from patient cells."
30686579,"A complete chart of cis-regulatory elements and their dynamic activity is necessary to understand the transcriptional basis of differentiation and function of an organ system. We generated matched epigenome and transcriptome measurements in 86 primary cell types that span the mouse immune system and its differentiation cascades. This breadth of data enable variance components analysis that suggests that genes fall into two distinct classes, controlled by either enhancer- or promoter-driven logic, and multiple regression that connects genes to the enhancers that regulate them. Relating transcription factor (TF) expression to the genome-wide accessibility of their binding motifs classifies them as predominantly openers or closers of local chromatin accessibility, pinpointing specific cis-regulatory elements where binding of given TFs is likely functionally relevant, validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Overall, this cis-regulatory atlas provides a trove of information on transcriptional regulation through immune differentiation and a foundational scaffold to define key regulatory events throughout the immunological genome."
30686576,"At the time of publication, radiopharmaceuticals labelled with thorium-227 are in clinical trials in Europe for the treatment of various types of cancer. In part I of this two-part series the primary standardisation of an aqueous solution of <sup>227</sup>Th was reported. In part II, the activity derived from the recommended absolute γ-ray emission intensities have been compared to that from the primary standardisation techniques. This comparison showed a negative bias of 4% in the determined activity per unit mass with an 11% spread in the activities determined for the eight most intense γ-ray emissions (I<sub>γ</sub> > 1%) from the <sup>227</sup>Th α decay. Using the standardised <sup>227</sup>Th, measurements of the characteristic γ-ray emissions from the <sup>223</sup>Ra excited states were made using a calibrated HPGe γ-ray spectrometer. This has enabled the absolute intensities of 70 γ ray emissions from the <sup>227</sup>Th α-decay to be experimentally determined. A significant improvement over the precision of the recommended normalisation scaling factor has been made, with a value of 12.470 (35) % determined. Typically, the precision of the intensities has been improved by an order of magnitude or greater than current recommended values. The correlation matrices for pairs of the most intense γ-ray emission intensities are presented."
30686507,"Pathogenic variants of the KCNJ13 gene are known to cause Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA16), an inherited pediatric blindness. KCNJ13 encodes the Kir7.1 subunit that acts as a tetrameric, inwardly rectifying potassium ion channel in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to maintain ionic homeostasis and allow photoreceptors to encode visual information. We sought to determine whether genetic approaches might be effective in treating blindness arising from pathogenic variants in KCNJ13. We derived human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-RPE cells from an individual carrying a homozygous c.158G>A (p.Trp53<sup>∗</sup>) pathogenic variant of KCNJ13. We performed biochemical and electrophysiology assays to confirm Kir7.1 function. We tested both small-molecule readthrough drug and gene-therapy approaches for this ""disease-in-a-dish"" approach. We found that the LCA16 hiPSC-RPE cells had normal morphology but did not express a functional Kir7.1 channel and were unable to demonstrate normal physiology. After readthrough drug treatment, the LCA16 hiPSC cells were hyperpolarized by 30 mV, and the Kir7.1 current was restored. Similarly, we rescued Kir7.1 channel function after lentiviral gene delivery to the hiPSC-RPE cells. In both approaches, Kir7.1 was expressed normally, and there was restoration of membrane potential and the Kir7.1 current. Loss-of-function variants of Kir7.1 are one cause of LCA. Using either readthrough therapy or gene augmentation, we rescued Kir7.1 channel function in iPSC-RPE cells derived from an affected individual. This supports the development of precision-medicine approaches for the treatment of clinical LCA16."
30686364,"Ballistic traumas are defined by a projectile entering the body. Such projectiles include bullets, birdshot, and metal fragments from the covering or the contents of an explosive device. They frequently cause severe wounds characterized by a range of clinical pictures and a large spectrum of concomitant wounds. The major aims of imaging are to define the path of the projectile or projectiles, to evaluate which tissues have been injured, to estimate the severity of injury, and to determine what additional studies are needed. A routine radiograph is performed in patients with gunshot wounds. The diagnostic approach has been changed by the use of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) due to its technical developments particularly faster data acquisition and advanced image reconstructions. In the evaluation of patients with gunshot injuries, MDCT is considered the method of choice to identify hemorrhage, bullet, bone fragments, air, hemothorax, nerve lesions, musculoskeletal lesions, and vessel injuries. Moreover, MDCT technology and multiplanar reformation postprocessing allow meticulous trajectory analysis that potentially benefits the clinical outcomes of patients aiding time-saving triage and correct image-based diagnosis of organ and vessel damage. Familiarity of ballistics and forensic sciences will therefore help the radiologist in assessment and localization of the damage caused by projectiles."
30686363,"Emergency department assessment is a critical opportunity to identify elder abuse and violence against women, which represent a growing problem, requiring the attention of health care systems. Elder abuse is most frequently perpetrated by family members because of the higher levels of stress, burnout, and financial problems affecting the caregivers that can even lead to deadly consequences. Intimate partner violence is defined as physical, sexual, or psychological harm caused to another by a current or former partner or spouse, and can range from a single acute hit to chronic battering, varying in frequency and severity. Radiologists have a critical role in detecting those injury findings suggestive of abuse and violence. When appropriate, additional information about the social circumstances in which an injury took place, linked with imaging findings, may also be helpful in diagnosing abuse. The purpose of this article is to highlight the role of diagnostic imaging in the detection of lesions compatible with domestic abuse in elderly patients and women, and to allow the recognition of the alterations most frequently associated with this type of violence."
30685917,"Worldwide increasing prevalence of obesity and lifestyle changes has put nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as the most prevalent liver disease of the coming decade. NAFLD not only causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but also acts as a component of metabolic syndrome together with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dyslipidemia. Consequently, its mutual cause-and-effect interactions have brought a huge clinical and financial burden to patients and society."
30685765,"The concept of precision medicine is becoming increasingly popular. The use of big data, genomics and other 'omics' like metabolomics, proteomics and trancriptomics could make the dream of personalized medicine become a reality in the near future. As far as polygenic forms of diabetes like type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM) are concerned, interesting leads are emerging, but precision diabetes is still in its infancy. However, with regard to monogenic forms of diabetes like Maturity-Onset-diabetes of the young (MODY) and Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), rapid strides have been made and precision diabetes has already become part of the clinical tools used at advanced diabetes centres. In patients with some monogenic forms of diabetes, if the appropriate gene defects are identified, insulin injections can be stopped and they can be replaced with oral sulphonylurea (SU) drugs. In the coming years, rapid strides can be expected to be made in the field of precision diabetes, thereby making the control of diabetes more effective and hopefully leading to prevention of its complications and improvement of the quality of life of people afflicted with diabetes."
30685729,"Untreated Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and myocardial infarction. However, it is difficult to predict which patients are at particularly high risk. This systematic review aimed to identify potentially useful circulating biomarkers that could predict cardiometabolic complications in OSA. We searched Cochrane (EBM), EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. Search concepts included: ""Obstructive Sleep Apnea"", ""Biomarkers"" and ""Risk-Stratification"". Manuscripts were included if they studied adults with OSA, circulating (blood) markers, and relationships with clinical outcomes. After screening, 10 were included. Studies addressed cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, end-stage renal disease and metabolic syndrome. In general, levels of inflammatory markers, adhesion molecules, and vascular proteins were associated with the presence of cardiometabolic disease in OSA patients. Although studies regarding prognostic circulating biomarkers in OSA are limited, a number of potentially promising biomarkers were identified in our review. However, more research is needed using prospective cohorts to determine which biomarkers are most robustly associated with and useful in predicting future cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae in OSA patients. Identification of such biomarkers could guide more selective and targeted therapy for OSA in an emerging era of precision-based medicine."
30685654,"Currently, an increasing number of patients are seriously affected by acute thrombotic events. In China, Polygonum multiflorum (PM) is commonly used to treat diseases associated with thrombosis. Our previous work showed that PM could inhibit the platelet aggregation that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis. However, the constituents of PM are complicated, and quality control methods cannot completely ensure the quality and clinical efficacy. In an attempts to explore this problem, we constructed a direct bioassay method to evaluate the antiplatelet aggregation effects of PM. To ensure the precision and reliability of this bioassay, we optimized and standardized the experimental conditions and then tested the standardized bioassay by analyzing 10 PM samples. Additionally, we combined chemical and biological evaluation methods to identify antiplatelet aggregation markers. The evaluation indicated that 10 samples of PM could inhibit platelet aggregation and there was a notable difference in biopotency between the different PM groups. Chemical fingerprints revealed variations in the contents of the 7 main peaks. Trans-2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxy-stilbene-2-O-β-d-glucoside and catechin might be active constituents of antiplatelet aggregation as determined by spectrum-effect relationships. This work indicates that bioassay and spectrum-effect relationships are useful tools to associate sample quality with the potential chemical markers linked to the clinical effects of Traditional Chinese Medicines."
30685448,"There is a great need for fast, simple and precise diagnostic assays capable of direct quantification of biomarkers in complex biological matrices. Yet, the commonly used techniques such as ELISA/Immunoassays are tedious and involve various steps e.g. blocking, washing and signal development. Moreover, most of these assays have very limited ability of detecting small molecules and have hardly any multiplexing capabilities. The gold standard and alternative, mass-spectrometry, however, depends upon expensive hardware and is incompatible with point of care (POC) diagnostics. As opposed to POC assays for proteins or larger targets where variable formats are readily available. Here, we present a simple, versatile and fast one-step assay for detecting a small molecule, ethanolamine as example. The assay makes use of commonly available qPCR machines to detect target-concentration dependent shifts in the melting temperatures of aptamer beacons. The method allows detection of ethanolamine in the low nM range without requiring tedious elaboration of assay conditions as required for molecular beacons at room temperature. If generalizable, it may change the situation of small molecule assays significantly."

30685285,"With the widespread use of sex-steroid hormones in contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, there is an increasing need for reliable analytical methods. We report the development of a sensitive and robust UPLC-MS/MS method for quantitation of both endogenous and synthetic sex-steroid hormones in human serum."
30685097,"The early detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) upon the onset of chest pain symptoms is crucial for patient survival. However, this detection is challenging, particularly without a persistent elevation of ST-segment reflected in an electrocardiogram or in blood tests. A majority of the available point-of-care testing devices allow accurate and rapid diagnosis of AMI. However, AMI diagnosis is reliable only at intermediate and later stages, with myocardial injury (> 6 h) and MI, based on the expression of specific cardiac biomarkers including troponin I or T (cTnI or cTnT), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and myoglobin. Diagnosis at the early myocardial ischemia stage is not possible. To overcome this limitation, a sensitive and rapid microfluidic paper-based device (µPAD) was developed for the simultaneous detection of multiple cardiac biomarkers for the early and late diagnosis of AMI. The glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB (GPBB) was detected during early (within first 4 h) ischemic myocardial injury. On the same µPAD platform, detection of prolonged elevation of levels of cTnT and CK-MB, which are only produced 6 h after the onset of chest pain in human serum, was possible. Sandwich immunoassay performed on the µPAD achieved reproducibility (RSD approximately 10% and intra-and inter-day precision (CV 10-20%, 99th percentile), as well as consistently stable test results for 28 days, with strong correlation (r<sup>2</sup>= 0.962), using the standard Siemens Centaur XPT Immunoassay system. The present findings indicate the potential of the µPAD platform as a point-of-care device for the early diagnosis and prognosis of AMI."
30685078,"Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has transformed the management of localized prostate cancer by improving identification of clinically significant disease at diagnosis. Approximately 20% of primary prostate tumors are invisible to mpMRI, and we hypothesize that this invisibility reflects fundamental molecular properties of the tumor. We therefore profiled the genomes and transcriptomes of 40 International Society of Urological Pathology grade 2 tumors: 20 mpMRI-invisible (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] v2 <3) and 20 mpMRI-visible (PI-RADS v2 5) tumors. mpMRI-visible tumors were enriched in hallmarks of nimbosus, an aggressive pathological, molecular, and microenvironmental phenomenon in prostate cancer. These hallmarks included genomes with increased mutation density, a higher prevalence of intraductal carcinoma/cribriform architecture pathology, and altered abundance of 102 transcripts, including overexpression of noncoding RNAs such as SCHLAP1. Multiple small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were identified, and a snoRNA signature synergized with nimbosus hallmarks to discriminate visible from invisible tumors. These data suggest a confluence of aggressive molecular and microenvironmental phenomena underlie mpMRI visibility of localized prostate cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the correlation between tumor biology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visibility in a group of patients with low- intermediate-risk prostate cancer. We observed that MRI findings are associated with biological features of aggressive prostate cancer."
30685041,"A new split-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensing platform was designed for sensitive detection of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) in foodstuffs, coupling with enzymatic hydrolysate-triggered etching reaction of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) on cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles-functionalized interface. Initially, the photosensitive electrode was prepared by coating CoOOH nanosheets on the surface of CdS nanoparticles to quench the photocurrent. Thereafter, a competitive-type enzyme immunoreaction was carried out on monoclonal anti-AFB<sub>1</sub> antibody-conjugated magnetic bead by using alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled bovine serum albumin-AFB<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>-BSA) conjugate as the competitor. With the formation of immunocomplex, the carried ALP hydrolyzed ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) into ascorbic acid (AA) and phosphate. The former ascorbic acid produced etched or dissolved CoOOH nanosheets into Co<sup>2+</sup> ions, thus resulting in the exposure of CdS nanoparticles on the surface to enhance the photocurrent of the modified electrode. Under optimum conditions, the photocurrent decreased linearly with the increasing AFB<sub>1</sub> concentration in the dynamic range of 0.01-10 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, and the limit of detection was 2.6 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The precision of this method (expressed as RSD) was ±8.6%. In addition, the accuracy was monitored by analyzing spiked food samples, and gave the well-matched results with the referenced ELISA method."
