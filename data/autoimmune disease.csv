30698999,"CRISPR technology has opened a new era of genome interrogation and genome engineering. Discovered in bacteria, where it protects against bacteriophage by cleaving foreign nucleic acid sequences, the CRISPR system has been repurposed as an adaptable tool for genome editing and multiple other applications. CRISPR's ease of use, precision, and versatility have led to its widespread adoption, accelerating biomedical research and discovery in human cells and model organisms. Here we review CRISPR-based tools and discuss how they are being applied to decode the genetic circuits that control immune function in health and disease. Genetic variation in immune cells can affect autoimmune disease risk, infectious disease pathogenesis, and cancer immunotherapies. CRISPR provides unprecedented opportunities for functional mechanistic studies of coding and noncoding genome sequence function in immunity. Finally, we discuss the potential of CRISPR technology to engineer synthetic cellular immunotherapies for a wide range of human diseases. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Immunology Volume 37 is April 26, 2019 Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
30698500,"Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and bacteremia. The mortality and morbidity of invasive pneumococcal disease are high among adults aged >65 years or those with underlying chronic or immunosuppressive conditions. A recent systematic review showed that patients treated with immunosuppressive agents have impaired immune responses to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine compared with healthy subjects. A more favorable response is observed in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha-blocking agents compared with those treated with other immunosuppressive agents. Low systemic corticosteroid doses do not affect the responses to pneumococcal vaccines. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis receiving immunosuppressive therapy exhibit decreased immunogenicity to pneumococcal vaccines. The effects of T-cell-dependent PCV possibly depend on host memory B cells in some disease conditions. Several immunosuppressive therapy types and disease conditions may affect the responses to pneumococcal vaccines. Immunization should be administered before immunosuppressive medication initiation whenever possible."
30698146,"Vitiligo is associated with (autoimmune) thyroid disease. However, confounding factors, including type and onset of vitiligo, require elucidation. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify vitiligo patients with increased risk of (autoimmune) thyroid disease. Studies were identified based on searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception of these databases to August 31st, 2017. Odds ratios (ORs) for the prevalence of (autoimmune) thyroid disease and thyroid antibodies in vitiligo patients were pooled, and subgroup analysis was performed. Thirty-seven studies with 78,714 vitiligo patients met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of thyroid disease (TD) (OR: 3.932; 95% CI: 2.230-6.933), autoimmune TD (OR: 5.879; 95% CI: 2.682-12.885), anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibody (OR: 3.838; 95% CI: 2.968-4.963), and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (OR: 3.513; 95% CI: 2.346-5.260) was significantly higher in vitiligo patients than in controls. Notably, the prevalence of TD and anti-TPO antibody was significantly higher in patients with non-segmental vitiligo, compared to those with segmental vitiligo. In contrast, the prevalence of TD was significantly lower in early-, compared to the late-onset vitiligo group (OR: 0.333; 95% CI: 0.244-0.453). Physicians should be aware of the increased risk of (autoimmune) thyroid disease in vitiligo patients. We recommend routine screening for anti-thyroid antibodies in vitiligo patients."
30698041,"The aim of this study is to evaluate ovarian reserve in women with psoriasis. Thirty-six women with psoriasis and 36 healthy women were enrolled in this prospective study. On day 3 of the menstrual cycle, blood samples for AMH and other hormones were collected. On the same day, antral follicle count (AFC), and ovarian volumes were measured. A multiple regression analysis was carried out to examine the contribution of factors to the serum AMH levels in patients with psoriasis. The serum AMH levels and ovarian volumes were lower in the psoriasis group than in the control group (1.85 ± 1.13 ng/ml vs 2.46 ± 1.21 ng/ml, p = .029 and 10.43 ± 3.08 cm<sup>3</sup> vs 11.93 ± 3.01 cm<sup>3</sup>, p = .038). However, the mean AFC between the two groups was not significantly different. The psoriasis area severity index (PASI) score did not correlate with AMH. On the other hand, the duration of the disease negatively correlated with AMH, total AFC and ovarian volume. In the multiple regression analysis, duration of disease and total AFC were the most significant contributors to the serum AMH levels in patients with psoriasis. Autoimmune diseases may affect ovarian reserve regardless of immunosuppresive treatment. Longitudinal follow-ups regarding reproductive function might be required in women with psoriasis."
30697467,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, mostly affecting young adults. Diamine oxidase is an enzyme essential for histamine production. Histamine which is produced mostly by mast cells can have effects on different aspects of immune system via its different histamine receptors (H1R, H2R, H3R and H4R). The crucial role of diamine oxidase and histamine in immune balance has been documented in different studies and experiments both on MS patients and on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this regard, we aimed to measure the level of histamine and diamine oxidase in the serum of MS patients."
30697352,"Despite high mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is underestimated in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), due to its atypical presentation. The multi-faceted nature of CVD in ARDs created the need of a dedicated outpatient cardio-rheumatic clinic. Clinical examination, rest/exercise ECG, echocardiography, nuclear techniques and cardiac catheterisation were used as first-line diagnostic tools. Although the currently used non-invasive modalities perform well in cardiology, they are unable to diagnose the complex CVD pathophysiology of ARDs. The application of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) offers some significant advantages. CMR is versatile and can be used to perform functional, stress-rest perfusion, fibrosis and evaluation of great, peripheral and coronary vessels patency, without the use of ionising radiation, allowing early diagnosis of CVD and prompting modifications of anti-rheumatic and cardiac treatment."

30697217,"Dietary habits have a profound impact on intestinal homeostasis and in general on human health. In Western countries, high intake of calories derived from fried products, butter and processed meat is favored over dietary regimens rich in fruits and vegetables. This type of diet is usually referred to as Western-type diet (WTD) and it has been associated with several metabolic and chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we describe how WTD promotes intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammation and alters mucosal immunity acting on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a microbiota-dependent or -independent fashion, ultimately leading to higher susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, summarizing recent findings, we propose how dietary supplementation with fiber and vitamins could be used as a tool to modulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotype and function, ameliorating inflammation and restoring mucosal homeostasis."
30696851,"Autoimmune Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease caused by the selective destruction of insulin producing beta cells in human pancreas. DM is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that bind a variety of islet-cell antigens. The 65 kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65) is a major autoantigen recognized by these autoantibodies. Autoantibodies to GAD65 (GADA) are considered predictive markers of the disease when tested in combination with other specific autoantibodies. In order to produce reliable immunochemical tests for large scale screening of autoimmune DM, large amounts of properly folded GAD65 are needed. Herein, we report the production of human GAD65 using the baculovirus expression system in two species of larvae, Rachiplusia nu and Spodoptera frugiperda. GAD65 was identified at the expected molecular weight, properly expressed with high yield and purity in both larvae species and presenting appropriate enzymatic activity. The immunochemical ability of recombinant GAD65 obtained from both larvae to compete with [<sup>35</sup>S]GAD65 was assessed qualitatively by incubating GADA-positive patients' sera in the presence of 1 μM of the recombinant enzyme. All sera tested became virtually negative after incubation with antigen excess. Besides, radiometric quantitative competition assays with GADA-positive patients' sera were performed by adding recombinant GAD65 (0.62 nM-1.4 µM). All dose response curves showed immunochemical identity between proteins. In addition, a bridge-ELISA for the detection of GADA was developed using S. frugiperda-GAD65. This assay proved to have 77.3% sensitivity and 98.2% of specificity. GAD65 could be expressed in insect larvae, being S. frugiperda the best choice due to its high yield and purity. The development of a cost effective immunoassay for the detection of GADA was also afforded."
30696705,"The controlled production and downstream signaling of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are important for immunity and its anticancer effects. Although chronic stimulation with TNF-α is detrimental to the health of the host in several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, TNF-α-contrary to what its name implies-leads to cancer formation by promoting cell proliferation and survival. Smac mimetic compounds (SMCs), small-molecule antagonists of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), switch the TNF-α signal from promoting survival to promoting death in cancer cells. Using a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify factors required for SMC-to-TNF-α-mediated cancer cell death, we identified the transcription factor SP3 as a critical molecule in both basal and SMC-induced production of TNF-α by engaging the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional pathway. Moreover, the promotion of TNF-α expression by SP3 activity confers differential sensitivity of cancer versus normal cells to SMC treatment. The key role of SP3 in TNF-α production and signaling will help us further understand TNF-α biology and provide insight into mechanisms relevant to cancer and inflammatory disease."
30696682,"The clinical characteristics of autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases are diverse. Yet, medical treatment and the associated complications are similar, that is, the occurrence of long-term side effects and the problem that a significant proportion of patients are non-responders. Therefore, new therapeutic options are needed. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, is effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma and data from experimental models and case reports suggest an effect in the treatment of autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity. In our study, we will determine the effect of bortezomib treatment on a shared surrogate parameter for clinical efficacy, namely change in autoantibody levels, which we chose as primary parameter."

30696605,"Collagenous colitis is a relatively rare disorder affecting mainly middle-aged women where they present with chronic non-bloody diarrhea. Both with lymphocytic colitis they compose microscopic colitis. The exact cause of collagenous colitis is still unknown however; many potential pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed but no convincing mechanism has been identified. Collagenous colitis has been linked to medications mainly NSAIDs, SSRIs, and PPIs. It is also believed that collagenous colitis is autoimmune disease and there are weak believe it could have some genetic inheritance. We reported before two cases of collagenous colitis developed in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis while they were in complete mucosal remission after being treated with tumor necrosis factors-α inhibitors. In this article we will try to explain how collagenous colitis can develop in patients with inflammatory bowel disease especially those on tumor necrosis factors-α inhibitors."

30696333,"The intronic hexanucleotide expansion in the C9orf72 gene is one of the leading causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two devastating neurodegenerative diseases. C9orf72 forms a heterodimer with SMCR8 (Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosome region, candidate 8) protein. However, the physiological function of SMCR8 remains to be characterized. Here we report that ablation of SMCR8 in mice results in splenomegaly with autoimmune phenotypes similar to that of C9orf72 deficiency. Furthermore, SMCR8 loss leads to a drastic decrease of C9orf72 protein levels. Many proteins involved in the macroautophagy-lysosome pathways are downregulated upon SMCR8 loss due to elevated activation of MTORC1 and AKT, which also leads to increased spine density in the Smcr8 knockout neurons. In summary, our studies demonstrate a key role of SMCR8 in regulating MTORC1 and AKT signaling and tissue homeostasis.

30695331,"A variety of anti-rheumatic drugs including biologics are currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These drugs, as well as RA itself, can cause kidney injury. RA may trigger mesangial proliferative glomeru- lonephritis (MesPGN), membranous nephropathy (N), thin basement membrane disease, and renal amyloi- dosis. As for anti-rheumatic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) increase serum Cr lev- els due to a reduction of glomerular circulation, particularly in the presence of dehydration. Among disease- modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD), methotrexate as an anchor drug for RA rarely causes tubular ob- struction as a result of its crystallization, and bucillamine occasionally elicits IN. Calcineurin inhibitors induce vasoconstriction of the afferent arteries. Recently developed anti-rheumatic drugs, biologics, include biological inhibitors of TNF-a, IL6, and CD80/26. These can generally induce the remission of RA, while they have been reported to albeit uncom- monly trigger autoimmune renal disorders (AIRD). A recent meta-analysis identified a total of 29 cases with biologics-induced AIRD, 62% of who manifested AIRD within 12 months after treatment with biologics. AIRD cases were classified into 3 different groups: isolated autoimmune renal disorders (IARD, n =13), glo- merulonephritis with systemic vasculitis (GNSV, n= 12), and glomerulonephritis with lupus-like syndrome (GNLS, n=4). The IARD cases had 4 MesPGN, 4 MN, and 2 crescentic GN, while the GNSV cases had 8 crescentic GN and 3 purpura GN, and the GNLS cases had all MesPGN. To detect these renal disorders early in RA patients, urinalysis and serum Cr measurement should be peri- odically performed. New urinary biomarkers (L-FABP and Ngal) may be more sensitive for kidney injury. Notably, in RA patients receiving biologics, ANA, anti-dsDNA, and ANCA should also be tested at the base- line and regular intervals. [Review]."
30695329,"Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is indispensable for diagnosing and estimating clinical conditions of autoimmune diseases. This literature explains the usability and problem points regarding routine laboratory tests with examples of our own experiments regarding ANA diagnostics with some new technologies. The indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is the gold standard for ANA screening, and it can detect more than 100 different antibodies, including the anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as anti- cytoplasmic antibodies. However, complicated procedures of conventional IFA and visual interpretation require highly skilled laboratory staff. The EUROPattern Cosmic IFA System (EUROIMMUN, Cosmic Corporation) and HELIOS* (Aesku Diag- nostics, MBL), which are computer-aided microscope systems for ANA testing, showed concordance of the positivity rate as high as 93.3 and 91.9%, respectively, and concordance of the antibody titer as high as 94.0 and 98.8%, respectively (within +/-1 titer) compared with the conventional method, on the measurement of different populations for each system. Although the computer-aided microscope system is not considered a complete system and laboratory staff should verify each result, it is a useful system for routine ANA analysis because it contributes to ANA stand- ardization and an efficient workflow. In our previous study, we demonstrated that BioPlex2200 (Bio-Rad), a fully automated immunoassay ana- lyzer using suspension bead array technology, was useful for the clinical diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. As an ANA screening test, the positive rate was low (7.2%) in healthy subjects, and comparable with that of IFA ( X160). The prevalence of disease-specific ANA in connective tissue disease patients was comparable with the general occurrence rate except for anti-dsDNA antibody in SLE. In accordance with the results of double immunodiffusion and Western blotting with the conventional method, the concordance rate between BioPlex2200 and conventional methods was high (95.0-100%) except for anti-dsDNA antibody. To provide high-quality and prompt clinical tests while considering the efficiency of working and cost reduc- tion, each laboratory should actively innovate and operate these advanced inspection technologies.

30695328,"Recently, biological treatment agents such as antibody preparations have been widely used in clinical fields, and these agents provide benefits for many patients. They actually show effectiveness against lymphoma, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease. Accordingly, such biological treatment has altered the concept of treatment, from symptomatic therapy to maintenance of remission. However, it is a fact that there are also some patients for whom this treatment has little benefit. Antibodies for the treat- ment of rheumatoid arthritis can be divided into two groups: tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as cytokine signal blockade, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as signal blockade from CTLA-4 on the T-cell membrane. It is well- known that the action mechanism of these biological treatment agents can affect the immune system. Thus, cases with side effects, including abnormal laboratory data, must be reported for further study. Since these agents are extremely expensive, their benefit will be marked only when biomarkers for the early detection of complications and prediction of beneficial effects are developed. The aim of this symposi- um is to discuss the role of the clinical laboratory in this molecular-targeted therapy. [Review]."
30695316,"Lupus anticoagulant-hypothrombinemia syndrome (LAHS) is a rare disease involving hemorrhagic diathe- sis due to hypothrombinemia with lupus anticoagulant. We report a 28-week-pregnant woman at twenty years of age, who had been hospitalized with jaundice. In laboratory data, AST, ALT, and bilirubin were elevated and the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were prolonged. Although the liver failure was improved after she delivered a baby by Caesarean section, postoperative intraperitoneal bleeding persisted. The diagnosis by liver biopsy was autoimmune hepatitis. Although the bleeding was stopped on the seventh postoperative day, the prolongation of PT and APTT remained. LA was positive in the diluted Russell's viper venom time. Anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein anti- bodies were also positive. The prothrombin activity was reduced. A high titer of phosphatidylserine- dependent antiprothrombin antibody (aPS/PT), which causes bleeding, was observed. Based on these data, she was diagnosed with LAHS. The liver dysfunction and prolongation of PT and APTT were normalized following the administration of corticosteroids. In this case, aPS/PT may have contributed to the pathological physiology of LAHS. [Case Report]."
30695649,"""Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features"" (IPAF) is a research classification proposed by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society Task Force on Undifferentiated Forms of Connective Tissue Disease-associated Interstitial Lung Disease as an initial step to uniformly define, identify and study patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) that have features of autoimmunity, yet fall short of a characterizable connective tissue disease. Since its publication in July 2015, there has been substantial interest in IPAF. Centers from around the world have published their findings of retrospectively identified cohorts of patients that fulfill IPAF criteria, suggestions for modification of the criteria have been offered and patients that fulfill IPAF criteria are being included as a subset in the ongoing phase II multicenter unclassifiable ILD treatment trial with pirfenidone (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03099187). The IPAF designation represents an important first step toward studying and furthering our understanding of the natural history of this cohort of patients with ILD using uniform nomenclature and a standardized set of criteria. Prospective evaluations and, ideally, interdisciplinary and multicenter collaborations will inform best practices for treatment and management and will guide future refinement to the IPAF criteria. This review focuses on the relevant background that led to the development of IPAF, summarizes the proposed criteria, discusses cohort studies of patients with IPAF published to date and what they have taught us about the IPAF phenotype, and offers insights into future directions in this arena."

30694724,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disorder of the ocular surface and tear homeostasis that can result in discomfort, pain, and visual disturbance. Untreated, DED can become chronic, progressive, and significantly affect an individual's quality of life. Women are disproportionately affected by DED, are diagnosed at a younger age, and experience more severe symptoms compared with men. DED is associated with a wide range of comorbid conditions; there is a strong association between DED and autoimmune disorders, especially those that affect women at many times the rate of men. Treatment response questionnaires indicate women respond better to a wellness model of treatment for DED than men. Furthermore, women's health care-seeking behaviors provide opportunities for general practitioners, specialists, and women's health centers to help identify women with DED or at risk for DED for referral to an eye care specialist. This review of the prevalence of DED in women, and gender and sex-specific aspects of DED, highlight a significant opportunity for action. Earlier diagnosis and treatment of this common but burdensome condition could significantly improve a woman's quality of life."

30693654,"Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PORCN gene located on the X chromosome. Short stature was previously noted to be a common finding in FDH, however the etiology of this is unclear. The present study sought to elucidate specific causes for short stature by assessing growth charts, determining bone ages and auxologic measurements, examining laboratory data for the common causes of growth failure, assessing dietary intake, and performing a growth hormone stimulation test. Sixteen patients with FDH between the ages of 3 and 18 years of age consented to the study. While 11 out of 16 patients had short stature based on height less than 2 standard deviations below mid-parental target height percentile and bone age not suggestive of likely catch-up growth, only four had a BMI less than the 5th percentile for age. Laboratory studies did not support a gastrointestinal, allergy or autoimmune cause of growth failure. Three patients had results suggestive of possible growth hormone deficiency. Although short stature is a common feature in FDH, our data suggests that severe undernutrition is not common in this group and that there may be underlying treatable causes for this short stature in some patients."

30693467,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder whose pathology involves multiple immune cell types, including B and T lymphocytes as well as myeloid cells. While it is clear that autoantibody producing B cells as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help are key contributors to disease, little is known regarding the role of innate lymphoid cells such as Natural Killer (NK) cells in the pathogenesis of SLE. We have characterized the phenotype of NK cells by multicolor flow cytometry in a large cohort of SLE patients. While the overall percentage of NK cells was similar or slightly decreased compared to healthy controls, a subset of patients displayed a high frequency of NK cells expressing the proliferation marker, Ki-67, which was not found in healthy donors. Although expression of Ki67 on NK cells correlated with Ki67 on other immune cell subsets, the frequency of Ki67 on NK cells was considerably higher. Increased frequencies of Ki67+ NK cells correlated strongly with clinical severity and active nephritis and was also related to low NK cell numbers but not overall leukopenia. Proteomic and functional data indicate that the cytokine IL-15 promotes the induction of Ki67 on NK cells. These results suggest a role for NK cells in regulating the immune-mediated pathology of SLE as well as reveal a possible target for therapeutic intervention. This article is protected by copyright.

30693382,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a widely used drug for treatment of many malignant, rheumatic, and autoimmune diseases. However, hepatotoxicity remains one of the most serious side effects of MTX. The extrinsic coagulation pathway is activated after tissue injury through the release of tissue factor (TF) which activates a cascade of clotting factors including prothrombin and fibrinogen. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells express endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) as a source for nitric oxide (NO) that serves as vasodilator and antithrombotic factor. In the current study, we tested the possible role of coagulation system activation in MTX-induced hepatotoxicity. Our results showed that single-dose administration of MTX significantly altered rat liver functions with concurrent turbulence in redox status. Immunofluorescence staining showed accumulation of fibrin in the periportal hepatocytes and downregulation of eNOS expression in hepatic endothelial and sinusoidal cells following MTX treatment. Moreover, MTX administration increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NOSTRIN (eNOS traffic inducer) in the hepatic sinusoids. On the other hand, pre-treatment with enoxaparin rescued against MTX-induced liver injury with subsequent amelioration of liver redox status. Furthermore, it significantly prevented the effect of MTX on the expression of fibrin, iNOS, eNOS, and NOSTRIN. We concluded that liver tissue aggregation of the coagulation product, fibrin, may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MTX-induced liver injury."

30693161,"Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune bullous disease involving the skin and mucosa, most commonly treated with systemic corticosteroids. This case illustrates the importance of counseling patients on medication side effects and ensuring close physician follow-up during an extended course of steroids. A 46-year-old man presented to the emergency department with weakness, fatigue, dizziness and polyuria in the setting of eight weeks of prednisone therapy for a flare-up of his bullous disease. Labs were significant for a blood glucose of 786 mg/dL, negative urine ketones, a normal anion gap, and an acute kidney injury. Blood glucose improved to 413 mg/dL after initial treatment with fluid and insulin. The patient was admitted and acute kidney injury resolved. He remained hyperglycemic despite his adjusted prednisone taper and corrective scale insulin, so basal and scheduled, pre-prandial insulins were added. After discharge, he was bridged to steroid-sparing therapy (rituximab). Physicians should counsel patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita about the risks of steroid-induced diabetes mellitus and its associated complications including hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state and diabetic ketoacidosis. Primary care physicians should screen for hyperglycemia during therapy and consider alternative treatments when necessary."

Promoting Treg cell function and increasing their numbers might be useful in treating autoimmune disorders, as well as preventing allograft rejection. However, studies of mice and humans demonstrate that Treg cells promote cancer progression and suppress antitumor immunity. Therefore, suppressing Treg cell function or reducing their numbers could support the immune system's response to pathogenic microorganisms and tumors. As a result, there is great interest in investigating the Treg cells role in the treatment of hematological and nonhematological malignancies. Consequently, Treg cells could be a fundamentally important target for pathologies of the immune system. Targeting effector Treg cells could help to distinguish and selectively decrease these cells while preserving other Treg cells needed to suppress autoimmunity. Currently, a promising way to treat malignancies and other autoimmune disorders is stem cell transplantation. Stem cell transplants (SCT) can help to manage the production of Treg cells and also may produce more efficient Treg cells, thereby suppressing clinical disease progression. Specifically, mature T cells within the engrafted stem cells mediate this SCT beneficial effect. During SCT, the recipient's immune system is replaced with a donor, which allows for improved immune system function. In addition, SCT can protect from disease relapse, as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in transplant patients can be protective against cancer recurrence. The current review will define the role of regulatory T cells in treatment of malignancy. Additionally, it will summarize current promising research regarding the utility of regulatory T cells in stem cell transplantation."
30693002,"Autoantibody production occurs in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and numerous other autoimmune diseases. In some conditions, the autoantibodies are clearly pathogenic, whereas in others the roles are less defined. Here we review various autoantibodies associated with JIA, with a particular focus on antinuclear antibodies and antibodies recognizing citrullinated self-antigens. We explore potential mechanisms that lead to the development of autoantibodies and the use of autoantibody testing in diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, we compare and contrast JIA-associated autoantibodies with those found in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
30692998,"Among autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients have a unique predisposition to develop infections, which represents one of their main causes of morbidity and mortality. Many infections occur at disease diagnosis in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy, suggesting that the immunological abnormalities in SLE patients might be fundamental for the development of this complication. The aim of this study was to address the main clinical and immunological features associated with the development of infection and to create and validate a compound clinical-immunological infection predictive index in a cohort of SLE patients. We included 55 SLE patients with < 5 years since diagnosis. The clinical and immunological features were evaluated periodically and patients were followed-up during 1 year, searching for the development of infection. Immunophenotyping was performed by multiparametric flow cytometry and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were assessed by confocal microscopy. Eighteen patients (32.7%) presented 19 infectious events, 5 (26.3%) were severe. For the construction of the index, we performed a logistic regression analysis and the cutoff points were determined with ROC curves. Increased numbers of peripheral Th17 cells, B cell lymphopenia, and lower TLR2 expression in monocytes, as well as the use of cyclophosphamide were the major risk factors for the development of infection and thus were included in the index. Besides, patients that developed infection were characterized by increased numbers of low-density granulocytes (LDGs) and higher expression of LL-37 in NETs upon infection. Finally, we validated the index retrospectively in a nested case-control study. A score >1.5 points was able to predict infection in the following year (AUC = 0.97; LR- = 0.001, specificity 100%, <i>P</i> = 0.0003). Our index encompasses novel immunological features able to prospectively predict the risk of infection in SLE patients."
30692989,"Naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiate into effector and regulatory subsets of helper T (Th) cells in various pathophysiological conditions and modulate tissue inflammation in autoimmune diseases. While cytokines play a key role in determining the fate of Th cells differentiation, metabolites, and metabolic pathways profoundly influence Th cells fate and their functions. Emerging literature suggests that interplay between metabolic pathways and cytokines potentiates T cell differentiation and functions in tissue inflammation in autoimmune diseases. Metabolic pathways, which are essential for the differentiation and functions of Th cell subsets, are regulated by cytokines, nutrients, growth factors, local oxygen levels, co-activation receptors, and metabolites. Dysregulation of metabolic pathways not only alters metabolic regulators in Th cells but also affect the outcome of tissue inflammation in autoimmune and allergic diseases. Understanding the modulation of metabolic pathways during T cells differentiation may potentially lead to a therapeutic strategy for immune-modulation of autoimmune and allergic diseases. In this review, we summarize the role of metabolic checkpoints and their crosstalk with different master transcription factors and signaling molecules in differentiation and function of Th subsets, which may potentially unravel novel therapeutic interventions for tissue inflammation and autoimmune disorders."
30692987,"Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) deficiency is an auto-inflammatory disease due to mutations in cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 1 (<i>CECR1</i>) gene, currently named <i>ADA2</i>. The disease has a wide clinical spectrum encompassing early-onset vasculopathy (targeting skin, gut and central nervous system), recurrent fever, immunodeficiency and bone marrow dysfunction. Different therapeutic options have been proposed in literature, but only steroids and anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies (such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitor) proved to be effective. If a suitable donor is available, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be curative. Here we describe a case of ADA2 deficiency in a 4-year-old Caucasian girl. The patient was initially classified as autoimmune neutropenia and then she evolved toward an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)-like phenotype. The diagnosis of ALPS became uncertain due to atypical clinical features and normal FAS-induced apoptosis test. She was treated with G-CSF first and subsequently with immunosuppressive drugs without improvement. Only HSCT from a 9/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor, following myeloablative conditioning, completely solved the clinical signs related to ADA2 deficiency. Early diagnosis in cases presenting with hematological manifestations, rather than classical vasculopathy, allows the patients to promptly undergo HSCT and avoid more severe evolution. Finally, in similar cases highly suspicious for genetic disease, it is desirable to obtain molecular diagnosis before performing HSCT, since it can influence the transplant procedure. However, if HSCT has to be performed without delay for clinical indication, related donors should be excluded to avoid the risk of relapse or partial benefit due to a hereditary genetic defect."
30692924,"<b>Background:</b> The melanocortin α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an endogenous peptide with high affinity for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1r), has demonstrated prevention and reversal of intestinal and ocular inflammation in animal models. Preclinical studies were performed to determine whether two MC1r receptor agonists, PL-8177 and PL-8331, exhibit actions and efficacy similar to α-MSH in preventing and reversing intestinal and ocular inflammation. <b>Methods:</b> Both PL-8177 and PL-8331 were assessed in a Eurofins LeadProfilingScreen selectivity panel including 72 <i>in vitro</i> assays. PL-8177 and PL-8331 were evaluated in an <i>in vitro</i> assay using human whole blood stimulated by lipopolysaccharide to determine inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α); for comparison, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and α-MSH were used as positive controls. PL-8177, dosed at 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 μg, was assessed in a cannulated rat model of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced bowel inflammation versus vehicle and oral sulfasalazine. PL-8177 was also dosed at 0.3 mg/kg/mouse injected intraperitoneally versus untreated controls and α-MSH treatment in mice with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). PL-8331 at 3 doses, 3 times daily, was evaluated in a murine model of scopolamine-induced dry eye disease (SiccaSystem<sup>TM</sup> model), versus twice-daily Restasis<sup>®</sup> and Xiidra<sup>®</sup>. <b>Results:</b> Both PL-8177 and PL-8331 demonstrated no significant activity at the 1 μm concentration in any of the 72 <i>in vitro</i> assays. PL-8177 and PL-8331 inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α to a similar degree as ACTH and α-MSH. In the DNBS rat model of bowel inflammation, PL-8177 was significantly superior to untreated controls at all 3 doses (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in reducing bowel inflammation parameters, with effects similar to sulfasalazine. In the murine EAU model, PL-8177 significantly reduced retinal inflammation scores versus untreated controls (<i>P</i> = 0.0001) over 3-5 weeks, and to a similar degree as α-MSH. In the murine scopolamine-induced model of dry eye disease, PL-8331 reduced corneal fluorescein staining scores at all doses, significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.02) for the highest dose (1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mg⋅mL<sup>-1</sup>), and similarly to Restasis<sup>®</sup>; Xiidra<sup>®</sup> demonstrated no effect. <b>Conclusion:</b> The MC1r receptor agonists PL-8177 and PL-8331 exhibited actions similar to those of α-MSH in preventing and reversing intestinal and ocular inflammation in preclinical disease models."
30692825,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic autoimmune disease. Its major manifestation is persistent joint inflammation, which can lead to bone destruction and severe disability. The immunopathogenesis of RA is very complex, involving both innate and adaptive immune systems. Recently, the discovery of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has revolutionized the diagnosis and our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of RA. The presence of ACPAs is also closely linked to the disease activity of RA. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that ACPAs and protein citrullination are key issues for the development of RA. We have summarized the recent study results in this review. The first theory concerning the pathogenesis of RA proposed that ACPAs link the well-known genetic and environmental risk factors for developing RA. However, due to the close association between joint inflammation and ACPAs, a more direct role of ACPAs in the immunopathogenesis of RA is anticipated. Within the past 10 years, many studies, including some of our own, have shown that ACPAs can promote an inflammatory response through complement activation, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, and direct binding to key players, including monocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts, in the mediation of bone destruction in the joints of RA patients. We also present some new perspectives and issues that need to be further investigated."
30692806,"In half of the suspected autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) patients, no antibodies are identified despite extensive investigation. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a potential first-line therapy for various subtypes of AIE. Here, we present a case of autoantibody-negative-suspected AIE, managed successfully with TPE after patient showed no response to steroids. A total of 5 sessions of TPE was done. One standard TPE procedure session was 1.2-1.5 plasma volume exchanges using 5% albumin as a replacement fluid. After five sessions, patient's clinical condition improved significantly, and a repeated magnetic resonance imaging after 5th cycle of TPE revealed a reduction in the areas of signal alteration. This was suggestive of regression of disease. Patient was discharged on 10th day of hospital admission. With early suspicion even in the absence of detectable autoantibodies, TPE plays an important role in the management of encephalitis."

30692211,"Akt isoforms play key roles in multiple cellular processes; however, the roles of Akt-1 and Akt-2 isoforms in the development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity are poorly defined. In this study, we showed that <i>Akt1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice develop ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, whereas <i>Akt2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice develop exacerbated EAE, compared with wild-type mice. At the cellular level, Akt-1 appears to inhibit proliferation of thymus-derived regulatory T cells (tTregs), which facilitates Ag-specific Th1/Th17 responses. In a sharp contrast to Akt-1, Akt-2 potentiates tTreg proliferation in vitro and in vivo and suppresses Ag-specific Th1/Th17 responses. Furthermore, treating mice with established EAE with a specific Akt-1 inhibitor suppressed disease progression. Our data demonstrate that Akt-1 and Akt-2 differentially regulate the susceptibility of mice to EAE by controlling tTreg proliferation. Our data also indicate that targeting Akt-1 is a potential therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis in humans."
30692201,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially lethal mucocutaneous blistering disease characterized by IgG autoantibodies (AuAbs) binding to epidermal keratinocytes and inducing this devastating disease. Here, we observed that non-desmoglein (Dsg) AuAbs in serum of individuals with Dsg1/3 AuAb-negative acute PV are pathogenic, since IgGs from these patients induced skin blistering in neonatal mice due to suprabasal acantholysis. Serum levels of AuAbs to desmocollin 3 (Dsc3), M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3AR), and secretory pathway Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase isoform 1 (SPCA1) correlated with the disease stage of PV. Moreover, AuAb absorption on recombinant Dsc3, M3AR, or SPCA1 prevented both skin blistering in the passive transfer of AuAbs model of PV in BALB/c mice and significantly decreased the extent of acantholysis in a neonatal mouse skin explant model. Although acantholytic activities of each of these immunoaffinity-purified AuAbs could not induce a PV-like phenotype in vivo, their mixture produced a synergistic effect manifested by a positive Nikolsky sign in the skin of neonatal mice. The downstream signaling of all pathogenic non-Dsg AuAbs involved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated phosphorylation and elevation of cytochrome c release and caspase 9 activity. Anti-Dsc3 and anti-SPCA1 AuAbs also activated SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC). Of note, although a constellation of non-Dsg AuAbs apparently disrupted epidermal integrity, elimination of a single pathogenic AuAb could prevent keratinocyte detachment and blistering. Therefore, anti-Dsg1/3 AuAb-free PV can be a model for elucidating the roles of non-Dsg antigen-specific AuAbs in the physiological regulation of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and blister development."
30692164,"European League Against Rheumatism and are jointly supporting multiphase development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria based on weighted criteria and a continuous probability scale. Prior steps included item generation, item reduction and hierarchical organisation of candidate criteria using an evidence-based approach. Our objectives were to determine relative weights using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and to set a provisional threshold score for SLE classification. An SLE Expert Panel (8 European, 9 North American) submitted 164 real, unique cases with a wide range of SLE probability in a standardised format. Using the candidate criteria, experts scored and rank-ordered 20 representative cases. At an in-person meeting, experts reviewed inter-rater reliability of scoring, further refined criteria definitions and participated in an MCDA exercise. Based on expert consensus decisions on pairwise comparisons of criteria, 1000minds software calculated criteria weights and rank-ordered the remaining 144 cases based on their additive scores. The score of the lowest-ranked case for which complete expert consensus was achieved defined the provisional threshold classification score. Inter-rater reliability of scoring cases with the candidate criteria was good. MCDA involved 74 pairwise decisions and was repeated for the arthritis and mucocutaneous domains when the initial ranking of some cases did not match expert opinion. After criteria weights and additive scores were recalculated once, experts reached consensus for SLE classification for all cases scoring>83. Using an iterative process, the candidate criteria definitions were refined, preliminary weights were calculated and a provisional threshold score for SLE classification was determined."

Interest in AQP4 has increased since it was discovered to be the target antigen in the inflammatory autoimmune disease neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Emerging data suggest that AQP4 may also be implicated in the glymphatic system and may be involved in the clearance of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we will describe the role of AQP4 in the adult and developing brain as well as its implication for disease."
30691212,"Exact causes for autoimmune diseases remain unclear and no cures are available. Breakdown of immunotolerance could set the stage for unfettered immune responses that target self-antigens. Impaired regulatory immune mechanisms could have permissive roles in autoreactivity. Abnormal regulatory immune cell function, therefore, might be a major determinant of the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. All current treatments are associated with some level of clinical toxicity. Treatment to specifically target dysregulated immunity in these diseases would be a great advance. Extracellular adenosine is a signaling mediator that suppresses inflammation through activation of P1 receptors, most active under pathological conditions. Mounting evidence has linked alterations in the generation of adenosine from extracellular nucleotides by ectonucleotidases, and associated perturbations in purinergic signaling, to the immunological disruption and loss of immunotolerance in autoimmunity. Targeted modulation of the purinergic signaling by either targeting ectonucleotidases or modulating P1 purinergic receptors could therefore restore the balance between autoreactive immune responses; and thereby allow reestablishment of immunotolerance. We review the roles of CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes in inflammatory states and with the dysregulation of P1 receptor signaling in systemic and organ-specific autoimmunity. Correction of such perturbations could be exploited in potential therapeutic applications."

30687710,"Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an orphan autoimmune disease. Patients with EBA suffer from chronic inflammation as well as blistering and scarring of the skin and mucous membranes. Current treatment options rely on non-specific immunosuppression, which in many cases, does not lead to a remission of treatment. Hence, novel treatment options are urgently needed for the care of EBA patients. During the past decade, decisive clinical observations, and frequent use of pre-clinical model systems have tremendously increased our understanding of EBA pathogenesis. Herein, we review all of the aspects of EBA, starting with a detailed description of epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment options. Of note, pattern analysis via direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional skin lesion and novel serological test systems have significantly facilitated diagnosis of the disease. Next, a state-of the art review of the current understanding of EBA pathogenesis, emerging treatments and future perspectives is provided. Based on pre-clinical model systems, cytokines and kinases are among the most promising therapeutic targets, whereas high doses of IgG (IVIG) and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab are among the most promising ""established"" EBA therapeutics. We also aim to raise awareness of EBA, as well as initiate basic and clinical research in this field, to further improve the already improved but still unsatisfactory conditions for those diagnosed with this condition."
30687564,"Development of human autoimmune disorders results from complex interplay among genetic, environmental, and immunological risk factors. Despite much heterogeneity in environmental triggers, the leading genes that give the propensity for tissue-specific autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, are those associated with particular class II major histocompatibility complex alleles. Such genetic predisposition precipitates presentation of tissue antigens to MHC-II-restricted CD4 T cells. When properly activated, these self-reactive CD4 T cells migrate to the target tissue and trigger the initial immune attack. Using the non-obese diabetic mouse model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, much insight has been gained in understanding how presentation of physiological levels of self-antigens translates into pathological outcomes. In this review, we summarize recent advances illustrating the features of the antigen presenting cells, the sites of the antigen recognition, and the nature of the consequent T cell responses. We emphasize emerging evidence that highlights the importance of systemic presentation of catabolized tissue antigens in mobilization of pathogenic T cells. The implication of these studies in therapeutic perspectives is also discussed."

30687331,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as persistent synovitis and progressive joint destruction. Imatinib exhibited a therapeutic effect in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) via selective inhibition tyrosine kinases. The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib exhibits more durable hematological and cytogenetic effects and more potency compared to imatinib. However, the effect of dasatinib on CIA is poorly understood. The present study investigated the treatment effect of dasatinib on autoimmune arthritis. We demonstrated that dasatinib alleviated arthritis symptoms and histopathological destruction in CIA mice. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, and promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Dasatinib treatment also suppressed the expression of anti-mouse CII antibodies including total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG2b, in CIA mice. We further demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited the migration and proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA patients and promoted FLS apoptosis. The mRNA expression of MMP13, VEGF, FGF, and DKK1 was down-regulated in FLS treated with dasatinib. Our findings suggest that dasatinib exhibited treatment effects on CIA mice and that FLS are an important target cell of dasatinib treatment in autoimmune arthritis."
30687329,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which a strong inflammatory response causes the death of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells, while inefficient regulatory mechanisms allow that response to become chronic. Ethyl pyruvate (EP), a stable pyruvate derivate and certified inhibitor of an alarmin-high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), exerts anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and encephalomyelitis. To test its therapeutic potential in T1D, EP was administered intraperitoneally to C57BL/6 mice with multiple low-dose streptozotocin (MLDS)-induced T1D. EP treatment decreased T1D incidence, reduced the infiltration of cells into the pancreatic islets and preserved β-cell function. Apart from reducing HMGB1 expression, EP treatment successfully interfered with the inflammatory response within the local pancreatic lymph nodes and in the pancreas. Its effect was restricted to boosting the regulatory arm of the immune response through up-regulation of tolerogenic dendritic cells (CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup>) within the pancreatic infiltrates and through the enhancement of regulatory T cell (Treg) levels (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>). These EP-stimulated Treg displayed enhanced suppressive capacity reflected in increased levels of CTLA-4, secreted TGF-β, and IL-10 and in the more efficient inhibition of effector T cell proliferation compared to Treg from diabetic animals. Higher levels of Treg were a result of increased differentiation and proliferation (Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells), but also of the heightened potency for migration due to increased expression of adhesion molecules (CD11a and CD62L) and CXCR3 chemokine receptor. Treg isolated from EP-treated mice had the activated phenotype and T-bet expression more frequently, suggesting that they readily suppressed IFN-γ-producing cells. The effect of EP on Treg was also reproduced <i>in vitro</i>. Overall, our results show that EP treatment reduced T1D incidence in C57BL/6 mice predominantly by enhancing Treg differentiation, proliferation, their suppressive capacity, and recruitment into the pancreas."

30687315,"B-cell activation plays a crucial part in the immune system and is initiated via interaction between the B cell receptor (BCR) and specific antigens. In recent years with the help of modern imaging techniques, it was found that the cortical actin cytoskeleton changes dramatically during B-cell activation. In this review, we discuss how actin-cytoskeleton reorganization regulates BCR signaling in different stages of B-cell activation, specifically when stimulated by antigens, and also how this reorganization is mediated by BCR signaling molecules. Abnormal BCR signaling is associated with the progression of lymphoma and immunological diseases including autoimmune disorders, and recent studies have proved that impaired actin cytoskeleton can devastate the normal activation of B cells. Therefore, to figure out the coordination between the actin cytoskeleton and BCR signaling may reveal an underlying mechanism of B-cell activation, which has potential for new treatments for B-cell associated diseases."
30687310,"Galectins, a family of animal lectins, play central roles in immune system regulation, shaping both innate and adaptive responses in physiological and pathological processes. These include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic multifactorial autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory responses that affects both articular and extra-articular tissues. Galectins have been reported to play central roles in RA and its experimental animal models. In this perspective article we present new data highlighting the regulated expression of galectin-1 (Gal-1) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) in sera from RA patients under disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or corticoid treatment in the context of a more comprehensive discussion that summarizes the roles of galectins in joint inflammation. We found that Gal-1 levels markedly increase in sera from RA patients and positively correlate with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS) and disease activity score 28 (DAS-28) parameters. On the other hand, Gal-3 is downregulated in RA patients, but positively correlates with health assessment questionnaire parameter (HAQ). Finally, by generating receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves, we found that Gal-1 and Gal-3 serum levels constitute good parameters to discriminate patients with RA from healthy individuals. Our findings uncover a differential regulation of Gal-1 and Gal-3 which might contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects elicited by DMARDs and corticoid treatment in RA patients."
30687213,"<b>Background:</b> Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD ab) have been found in patients with limbic encephalitis (LE) and chronic pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy (FE). The objectives of the study were to: (1) analyze the clinical and neuroimaging course of patients with FE+GAD ab, (2) compare these characteristics with a control group, and (3) describe the most affected cerebral areas with structural and functional imaging. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with FE + high titers of GAD ab and a follow-up of at least 5 years were selected. Titers of serum GAD ab exceeding 2,000 UI/ml were considered high. Evolutive clinical and radiological characteristics were studied in comparison to two different control groups: patients with bilateral or with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (BMTS or UMTS) of a non-autoimmune origin. <b>Results:</b> A group of 13 patients and 17 controls were included (8 BMTS, 9 UMTS). The most frequent focal aware seizures (FAS) reported by patients were psychic (5/13: 33%). Somatosensorial, motor, and visual FAS (4/13:32%) (<i>p</i>: 0.045), musicogenic reflex seizures (MRS), and a previous history of cardiac syncope were reported only patients (2/13:16% each) (<i>p</i>: NS). Comparing EEG characteristics between patients and controls, a more widespread distribution of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) was observed in FE+ GAD ab patients than in controls (<i>p</i>:0.01). Rhythmic delta activity was observed in all controls in anterior temporal lobes while in patients this was less frequent (<i>p</i>: 0.001). No IED, even in 24 h cVEEG, was seen in 6 patients (46%).First MRI was normal in 4/5 (75%) patients. During the follow-up mesial temporal lobe (MTsL) sclerosis was observed in 5/8 (62%) of patients. All patients had abnormal FDG-PET study. MTL hypometabolism was observed in 10/11 (91%) patients, being bilateral in 7/11 (63%). In controls, this was observed in 16/17 (94%), and it was bilateral in 8/17 (47%) (<i>p</i>: NS). Insular hypometabolism was observed in 5/11 (45%) patients (<i>P</i>:0.002). <b>Conclusions:</b> Clinical, EEG, and FDG-PET findings in FE+GAD ab suggest a widespread disease not restricted to the temporal lobe. Progressive MTL sclerosis may be observed during follow-up. In comparison to what is found in patients with non-autoimmune MTL epilepsy, insular hypometabolism is observed only in patients with GAD ab, so it may be an important diagnostic clue."

We report the case of a 20-year-old female who presented with acute liver failure and associated monocular vision loss. WD was found to be a cause of her liver disease and decreased vision."
30687058,"Among the differential diagnoses that should be considered in acute respiratory failure (ARF) are infectious processes, autoimmune diseases, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary neoplasia. Timely diagnosis of lung neoplasia is complicated in the early stages. An opportune diagnosis, as well as the specific treatment, decrease mortality. ARF occurs 1 in 500 pregnancies and is most common during the postpartum period. Among the specific etiologies that cause ARF during pregnancy that must be considered are: (1) preeclampsia; (2) embolism of amniotic fluid; (3) peripartum cardiomyopathy; and (4) trophoblastic embolism. The case of a 36-year-old patient with a 33-week pregnancy and ARF is presented. The patient presented dyspnea while exerting moderate effort that progressed to orthopnea and type 1 respiratory insufficiency. Imaging studies showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and predominantly right areas of consolidation. Blood cultures, a galactomannan assay and IgG antibodies against <i>mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, were reported as negative. Autoimmune etiology was ruled out through an immunoassay. A percutaneous pulmonary biopsy was performed and an invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth pattern (i.e. lepidic pulmonary adenocarcinoma, LPA) result was reported. This etiology is rare and very difficult to recognize in acute respiratory failure cases. After infectious, autoimmune and interstitial lung fibrosis have been excluded the clinician must suspect of lung cancer in a patient with acute respiratory failure and chest imaging compatible with the presence of ground-glass nodular opacities, a solitary nodule or mass with bronchogram, and lung consolidation. In the presence of acute respiratory failure, the suspicion of pulmonary neoplasia in an adult of reproductive age must be timely. Failure to recognize this etiology can lead to fatal results."
30686983,"The hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and the overexpression of mTOR are considered to be the driving force behind Aβ plaques and Neurofibrillay Tangles (NFT's), hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is now evident that miscellaneous diseases such as Diabetes, Autoimmune diseases, Cancer, etc. are correlated with AD. Therefore, we reviewed the literature on the causes of AD and investigated the association of tau and mTOR with other diseases. We have discussed the role of insulin deficiency in diabetes, activated microglial cells, and dysfunction of blood-brain barrier (BBB) in Autoimmune diseases, Presenilin 1 in skin cancer, increased reactive species in mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated Cyclins/CDKs in promoting AD pathogenesis. We have also discussed the possible therapeutics for AD such as GSK3 inactivation therapy, Rechaperoning therapy, Immunotherapy, Hormonal therapy, Metal chelators, Cell cycle therapy, γ-secretase modulators, and Cholinesterase and BACE 1-inhibitors which are thought to serve a major role in combating pathological changes coupled with AD. Recent research about the relationship between mTOR and aging and hepatic Aβ degradation offers possible targets to effectively target AD. Future prospects of AD aims at developing novel drugs and modulators that can potentially improve cell to cell signaling, prevent Aβ plaques formation, promote better release of neurotransmitters and prevent hyperphosphorylation of tau."
30686971,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease. Recent studies have identified the DNA methylation loci associated with RA and found that DNA methylation was a potential mediator of genetic risk. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Several studies have indicated that DNA methylation levels are linked to PD, and genes related to the immune system are significantly enriched in PD-related methylation modules. Although recent studies have provided profound insights into the DNA methylation of both RA and PD, no shared co-methylation relationships have been identified to date. Therefore, we sought to identify shared co-methylation relationships linked to RA and PD. Here, we calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 225,239,700 gene pairs and determined the differences and similarities between the two diseases. The global co-methylation change between in PD cases and controls was larger than that between RA cases and controls. We found 337 gene pairs with large changes that were shared between RA and PD. This co-methylation relationship study represents a new area of study for both RA and PD and provides new ideas for further study of the shared biological mechanisms of RA and PD."
30686733,"Axon loss determines persistent disability in multiple sclerosis patients. Here, we use in vivo calcium imaging in a multiple sclerosis model to show that cytoplasmic calcium levels determine the choice between axon loss and survival. We rule out the endoplasmic reticulum, glutamate excitotoxicity, and the reversal of the sodium-calcium exchanger as sources of intra-axonal calcium accumulation and instead identify nanoscale ruptures of the axonal plasma membrane as the critical path of calcium entry."
30686269,"Immune thrombocytopenia is an acquired autoimmune disease. Recently, there has been evidence of thrombotic risk in patients with immune thrombocytopenia, but the mechanism is still inconclusive. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion therapy is considered an efficient treatment; however, it still is associated with adverse events of fever, chills, and hypotension, as well as serious complications such as thrombosis. We report a case a patient with relapsed immune thrombocytopenia who developed ischemic stroke after an intravenous immunoglobulin infusion."

30685931,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune-mediated chronic cholestatic liver disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a first-line drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PBC. It can effectively improve serum biochemical indicators, delay histological progress, and prolong the survival of non-transplant patients. However, around 40% of patients with PBC have a poor response to UDCA with a poor outcome. Early identification of patients with poor biochemical responses and timely second-line treatment may alter the course of the disease. This article summarizes the risk factors for the poor response of UDCA in the PBC."
30685918,"Autoimmune liver disease is a group of hepatobiliary injuries mediated by abnormal immunity. It mainly includes autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Recently, an advancement of diagnostic technology has improved the detection and treatment of autoimmune hepatitis. However, it is easy to be confused with other liver diseases. Thus, the standardization of diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune liver diseases has become a main concern. Moreover, new progress has been made in basic research and clinical treatment of autoimmune liver diseases since 2018. In this review, we have introduced the latest research advances for the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune liver diseases."

30685871,"Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are approved for B cell malignancies and novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitors undergo clinical testing also in B cell-driven autoimmune disorders. Btk in platelets mediates platelet activation via glycoprotein (GP) VI, which is crucial for atherosclerotic plaque-induced platelet thrombus formation. This can be selectively inhibited by Btk inhibitors. Since patients on second-generation Btk inhibitors apparently show less bleeding than patients on ibrutinib, we compared the effects of ibrutinib and four novel irreversible Btk inhibitors on GPVI-dependent platelet aggregation in blood and in vitro bleeding time. Low concentrations of collagen which induced the same low degree of GPVI-mediated platelet aggregation as atherosclerotic plaque material were applied. IC<sub>50</sub> values for collagen (0.2-0.5 µg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation after 15-minute pre-incubation were: ibrutinib 0.12 µM, BGB-3111 0.51 µM, acalabrutinib 1.21 µM, ONO/GS-4059 1.20 µM and evobrutinib 5.84 µM. Peak venous plasma concentrations of ibrutinib (0.5 µM), acalabrutinib (2 µM) and ONO/GS-4059 (2 µM) measured after anti-proliferative dosage inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation, but did not increase PFA-200 closure time on collagen/epinephrine. Closure times were moderately increased by 2- to 2.5-fold higher concentrations of these inhibitors, but not by BGB-3111 (1 µM) and evobrutinib (10 µM). Prolonging platelet drug exposure to 60 minutes lowered IC<sub>50</sub> values of any Btk inhibitor for GPVI-mediated aggregation by several fold, and 5- to 10-fold below anti-proliferative therapeutic drug plasma levels. In conclusion, low blood concentrations of ibrutinib and the novel Btk inhibitors suffice for GPVI selective platelet inhibition relevant for atherothrombosis but do not impair primary haemostasis."
30685844,"Severe socioeconomic deprivation (SED) and adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are significantly associated with the development in adulthood of (i) enhanced inflammatory status and/or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction and (ii) neurological, neuroprogressive, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms by which these associations take place are detailed. The two sets of consequences are themselves strongly associated, with the first set likely contributing to the second. Mechanisms enabling bidirectional communication between the immune system and the brain are described, including complex signalling pathways facilitated by factors at the level of immune cells. Also detailed are mechanisms underpinning the association between SED, ACE and the genesis of peripheral inflammation, including epigenetic changes to immune system-related gene expression. The duration and magnitude of inflammatory responses can be influenced by genetic factors, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, and by epigenetic factors, whereby pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species and nuclear factor-κB affect gene DNA methylation and histone acetylation and also induce several microRNAs including miR-155, miR-181b-1 and miR-146a. Adult HPA axis activity is regulated by (i) genetic factors, such as glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms; (ii) epigenetic factors affecting glucocorticoid receptor function or expression, including the methylation status of alternative promoter regions of NR3C1 and the methylation of FKBP5 and HSD11β2; (iii) chronic inflammation and chronic nitrosative and oxidative stress. Finally, it is shown how severe psychological stress adversely affects mitochondrial structure and functioning and is associated with changes in brain mitochondrial DNA copy number and transcription; mitochondria can act as couriers of childhood stress into adulthood."
30685643,"Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH) is a flavin-dependent enzyme essential to pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis, which serves as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. A novel series of hDHODH inhibitors was developed based on a lead which was obtained by a medicinal chemistry exploration. Most compounds showed moderate to significant potency against hDHODH, compounds 5d, 5e, and 6a effectively inhibited the activities of hDHODH with IC<sub>50</sub> values from 0.9 to 2.8 μM. Further studies showed that compound 5e also effectively suppressed proliferation of the activated PBMCs (IC<sub>50</sub> = 20.35 μM). Surprisingly, compound 5e also showed anti-pulmonary fibrotic activity similar to that of pirfenidone in vitro assay. Therefore, compound 5e might have potential to be developed as a novel hDHODH inhibitors for autoimmune diseases therapy."

30685523,"The APS ACTION International Clinical Database and Repository includes a secure web-based data capture system storing patient information including demographics, antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-related medical history, and aPL tests. Despite efforts at harmonization, inter-assay variability remains a problem in aPL testing. As a clinical repository open to researchers, ensuring comparability between assays and consistency in results between APS ACTION laboratories is essential to the validity of studies emerging from this network."
30685202,"Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma, SSc) is a multifaceted disease characterized by autoimmunity, vasculopathy, and fibrosis affecting the skin and internal organs. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment of SSc in recent years, SSc continues to cause reduced quality of life and premature mortality. Type I interferons (IFNs), a family of cytokines with essential roles in the immune response to microbial infection, play a pathogenic role in certain autoimmune diseases (reviewed elsewhere in this edition). Polymorphisms in interferon-regulatory factors confer an increased risk of SSc, and IFN excess is evident in the blood and skin of a large percentage of SSc patients. Here we describe the evidence of Type I IFN dysregulation in SSc, revealed predominately by genetics and gene expression profiling. We also discuss evidence regarding mechanisms by which Type I IFN might contribute to SSc pathogenesis, mechanisms driving excess Type I IFN production in SSc, and the potential roles of Type I IFNs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in SSc."
30685201,High serum interferon alpha (IFN-α) is an important heritable phenotype in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) which is involved in primary disease pathogenesis. High vs. low levels of IFN-α are associated with disease severity and account for some of the biological heterogeneity between SLE patients. The aim of the study was to replicate and fine-map previously detected genetic associations with serum IFN-α in SLE.
30685070,"Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas are selectively destroyed. Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) expressed in peri-islet Schwann cells (pSCs) and in the ductal cells of the pancreas is one of the candidate autoantigens for T1D. Immune responses to GFAP expressing cell types precede the islet autoimmunity in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice. By removing MHC class I from GFAP expressing cell types, we tested the role of autoantigens presented by these cell types in the development of invasive insulitis. Our findings indicate that antigens expressed by pancreatic ductal cells are important in the development of invasive insulitis in NOD mice."

30684748,"Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), is a rare autoimmune disease with an estimated incidence of approximately 0.11 to 2.66 new cases per 1 million people per year and an overall prevalence of 10.7 to 14 per 1 million adults [1]. No gender predominance or ethnic predisposition has clearly been demonstrated in CSS [1]. Most of the patients are misdiagnosed over a period of time prior to being correctly classified with the disease. Here, we report the complex case of a 64-year-old African American man with advanced heart failure who received a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and was subsequently diagnosed with EGPA. EGPA is a clinical syndrome that is associated with sequelae that can negatively add to the morbidity associated with LVAD placement."

30684216,"TSH receptor (TSHR) autoantibody (TRAb) is the serological hallmark of Graves' disease (GD). Third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using monoclonal TRAbs instead of TSH have been found useful for TRAb analysis recently. For the first time, a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against TSHR was analyzed for TRAb detection and compared with human mAb M22 and TSH by the same competitive binding assay technique. A mouse monoclonal antibody (T7) binding to the TSH receptor and inhibiting TSH binding was generated and used for TRAb analysis in a third-generation ELISA. Obtained TRAb levels were compared with a second-generation TRAb assay employing bovine TSH and a third-generation assay with human mAb M22 as TSHR-binding reagents by investigating 89 patients with GD, 56 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), 73 with non-autoimmune thyroid diseases, 17 with rheumatoid arthritis, and 100 healthy subjects. The T7-based TRAb ELISA did not reveal a significantly different assay performance (area under the curve [AUC]) in contrast to the TSH and M22-based TRAb ELISAs by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (AUC-T7 0.967, AUC-TSH 0.972, AUC-M22 0.958, p > 0.05, respectively). After adjustment of cutoffs by ROC, all three TRAb ELISAs demonstrated sensitivities and specificities above 89.9% and 96.0%, respectively. Both third-generation TRAb ELISAs showed a tendency for a higher prevalence of TRAb positives in HT in contrast to the second-generation ELISA. Mouse mAbs against the TSHR may be used for the reliable detection of TRAb by third-generation TRAb ELISA. The earlier reported higher sensitivity of third-generation TRAb ELISA in GD needs to be considered in the context of a slightly lower specificity regarding HT."
30684190,"Associations of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are unclear. We investigated the occurrence of RP together with prothrombotic state markers and fibrin clot properties in VTE patients. In this prospective cohort study we enrolled 360 patients free of known autoimmune disease. D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWF), plasma clot permeability (K<sub>s</sub>), clot lysis time (CLT) along with fibrinolysis activators and inhibitors were determined at least 3 months since the VTE event. The presence/absence of RP was diagnosed at least 6 months before VTE. Primary RP occurred in 57 subjects (17%) with a 3.6-fold higher prevalence among women. Patients with RP had 11% higher fibrinogen, 16% higher vWF, 5% lower K<sub>s</sub>, and 10% longer CLT (all p < 0.05). Females with RP (21%) had 6.6% lower K<sub>s</sub>, 11.2% longer CLT, and 18.5% higher vWF (all p < 0.05) compared with men. CLT was predicted by PAI-1 and vWF levels. Regression analysis showed that RP was a predictor of prolonged CLT in the whole patient group (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.92-6.24) and in women following VTE (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.31-5.78). Primary RP patients tend to form denser plasma fibrin clots displaying impaired lysability and increased endothelial damage. RP might be a novel risk factor for VTE, especially in women."
30684125,"The obstacle to successful remyelination in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, mainly lies in the inability of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to differentiate, since OPCs and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells that are unable to fully differentiate are found in the areas of demyelination. Thus, promoting the differentiation of OPCs is vital for the treatment of demyelinating diseases. Shikimic acid (SA) is mainly derived from star anise, and is reported to have anti-influenza, anti-oxidation, and anti-tumor effects. In the present study, we found that SA significantly promoted the differentiation of cultured rat OPCs without affecting their proliferation and apoptosis. In mice, SA exerted therapeutic effects on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), such as alleviating clinical EAE scores, inhibiting inflammation, and reducing demyelination in the CNS. SA also promoted the differentiation of OPCs as well as their remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination. Furthermore, we showed that the promotion effect of SA on OPC differentiation was associated with the up-regulation of phosphorylated mTOR. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SA could act as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of demyelinating diseases."
30684090,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease which may result in a higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and stroke. Tissue characterization and risk stratification of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are a challenging problem. Risk stratification of RA patients using traditional risk factor-based calculators either underestimates or overestimates the CV risk. Advancements in medical imaging have facilitated early and accurate CV risk stratification compared to conventional cardiovascular risk calculators."
30684040,"Biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) have transformed the treatment paradigm of chronic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), but they are often associated with adverse drug reactions. The present study evaluated the frequency, characteristics and type of infections, other than tuberculosis (TB), in ARD patients receiving bDMARDs. The multicentre, cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study was conducted across 12 centers in Karnataka, India, between January to August 2016. The study included patients receiving bDMARD therapy for various ARDs. Outcome variables considered were any infection, minor infections and major infections, other than TB. Clinical variables were compared between infection and no infection group, and the increase in the likelihood of infection with respect to various clinical variables was assessed. The study involved 209 subjects with a median (range) age of 41 (16-84) years and male to female ratio of 0.97:1. A total of 29 (13.88%) subjects developed infection following bDMARD therapy, out of whom a majority had minor infection (n = 26). The likelihood of developing any infection was noted to be more in subjects receiving anti-TNF (golimumab, P = 0.03) and those on three or more conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs (P < 0.01). Infection risk was higher in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (P = 0.04), other connective tissue disease (P < 0.01) and in patients with comorbidities (P = 0.13). The risk of infection was associated with the use of anti-TNF therapy and more than three csDMARDs, co morbidities and Adds such as systemic lupus erythematosus and connective tissue disease."
30684006,"According to the literature there are a large number of potential systemic contraindications for corneal refractive surgery. In cases with relative contraindications, surgery should be performed only after weighing up the individual risks and under controlled disease conditions; however, the ""evidence"" for many of these contraindications is based only on case reports or series, expert opinions or known complications in non-laser-assisted eye surgery. Randomized clinical trials are therefore required."
30683697,"Abatacept is a CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein that binds to the costimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 and blocks their interaction with the CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors expressed by T cells, therefore inhibiting T cell activation and function. Abatacept has shown clinical efficacy in treating some autoimmune diseases but has failed to show clinical benefit in other autoimmune conditions. The reasons for these disparate results are not clear and warrant further investigation of abatacept's mode of action. Longitudinal specimens from the Immune Tolerance Network's A Cooperative Clinical Study of Abatacept in Multiple Sclerosis trial were used to examine the effects of abatacept treatment on the frequency and transcriptional profile of specific T cell populations in peripheral blood. We found that the relative abundance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and regulatory T cells was selectively decreased in participants following abatacept treatment. Within both cell types, abatacept reduced the proportion of activated cells expressing CD38 and ICOS and was associated with decreased expression of genes that regulate cell-cycle and chromatin dynamics during cell proliferation, thereby linking changes in costimulatory signaling to impaired activation, proliferation, and decreased abundance. All cellular and molecular changes were reversed following termination of abatacept treatment. These data expand upon the mechanism of action of abatacept reported in other autoimmune diseases and identify new transcriptional targets of CD28-mediated costimulatory signaling in human regulatory T and Tfh cells, further informing on its potential use in diseases associated with dysregulated Tfh activity."
30683115,"Neurovascular, autoimmune, and traumatic injuries of the central nervous system (CNS) all have in common an initial acute inflammatory response mediated by influx across the blood-brain barrier of activated mononuclear cells followed by chronic and often progressive disability. Although some anti-inflammatory therapies can reduce cellular infiltration into the initial lesions, there are essentially no effective treatments for the progressive phase. We here review the successful treatment of animal models for four separate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative CNS conditions using a single partial MHC class II construct called DRa1-hMOG-35-55 or its newest iteration, DRa1(L50Q)-hMOG-35-55 (DRhQ) that can be administered without a need for class II tissue type matching due to the conserved DRα1 moiety of the drug. These constructs antagonize the cognate TCR and bind with high affinity to their cell-bound CD74 receptor on macrophages and dendritic cells, thereby competitively inhibiting downstream signaling and pro-inflammatory effects of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog, D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT=MIF-2) that bind to identical residues of CD74 leading to progressive disease. These effects suggest the existence of a common pathogenic mechanism involving a chemokine-driven influx of activated monocytes into the CNS tissue that can be reversed by parenteral injection of the DRa1-MOG-35-55 constructs that also induce anti-inflammatory macrophages and microglia within the CNS. Due to their ability to block this common pathway, these novel drugs appear to be prime candidates for therapy of a wide range of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative CNS conditions."

We present a rare case having a combination of these two diseases, and furthermore, histological evaluation could be performed before and after the development of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis over a period of only10 months."
30683020,"Dynamic epigenetic alterations accompanying CD4+ T helper cell differentiation have been implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins are epigenetic regulators that recognize and bind to acetylated histones in chromatin and are targets for pharmacological inhibition. In this study we tested a new BET inhibitor under clinical development, OTX015, to interrogate its effects on key CD4+ T cell subsets associated with autoimmunity."
